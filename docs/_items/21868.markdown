paraphrase: "Purchase of house: <strong>A</strong> purchases from <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> a house of 5 sq. r (c. 61,25 m&sup2;) outside the Zababa Gate in the district of Babylon. The house is situated on the upper west side next to the through-street (<em>sūqu āṣ&ucirc;</em>), on the lower west side next to the house of <strong>C</strong><sub>1</sub>, on the upper northern front next to the house of <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>, and on the lower southern front next to the house of <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong>. The agreed price is 13 &frac12; shekels of silver per sq. r, so <strong>A</strong> pays 1 mina 7 &frac12; shekels of silver and additional 2 &frac12; shekels for the clothing of the mistress of the house (<em>lubāru &scaron;a bēlet bīti</em>). <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> receive 1 mina and 10 shekels of block silver in total. The document closes with the usual final clauses regarding the reception of the money, exclusion of further litigation on part of the seller&rsquo;s party on pain of paying the price 12 times over and a further clause concerning settlement of excess or lack of sq. r according to the agreed price. 5 witnesses (<em>ina kanāk ṭuppi</em>), including the uncle of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong><sub>-3</sub> (Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-zēri/Mu&scaron;allim-Marduk//Nappāhu), who took 3 shekels of silver as his gift (<em>qi&scaron;tu</em>), and the scribe (Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;allim//Miṣirāya). Fingernail impressions of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> have been placed instead of seals.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāhu;<strong> B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Bēl-ahhē-erība/Nab&ucirc;-balāssu-iqbi//Nappāhu; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Iqī&scaron;a-Marduk/Nab&ucirc;-balāssu-iqbi//Nappāhu; <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> = Bēl-ēṭir/Nab&ucirc;-balāssu-iqbi//Nappāhu; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>&nbsp;= Bēl-iddin/Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir//Rēmut-ilī; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Marduk-&scaron;umu-uṣur/&Scaron;a,-Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;ū//Pahāru; <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-zēri/Mu&scaron;allim-Marduk//Nappāhu<br /> &nbsp;"
