After the purchase the slave was given to the house of a Persian (<em>&scaron;a bīt parsāyi</em>) of the household of <strong>D</strong>, who sent him back (to <strong>B</strong>?). <strong>A</strong> receives the 2 minas 15 shekels of silver and its interest and he returns the pertaining documents (<em>uˀiltu</em>) to <strong>B</strong>. 4 witnesses and the scribe (Marduk-&scaron;umu-ibni/Bēl-aplu-iddin//Egibi).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Habaṣīru/Tabn&ecirc;a; <strong>B </strong>= Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāhu; <strong>C</strong>&nbsp;= Nab&ucirc;-ittannu; <strong>D</strong> = Marduk-&scaron;āpik-zēri<br /> &nbsp;"
