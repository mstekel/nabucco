paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver with prebend as security: <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> owe 5/6 mina of silver of 1/8 alloy to <strong>A</strong>. The debt will bear a yearly interest of 12 shekels of silver per mina (20 %). They pledge the prebend of Kāribu of the gate of the shrine of Marduk as security. No one else has right of disposal (<em>&scaron;alāṭu</em>) over the prebend as long as the debt towards <strong>A</strong> stands. <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>vouch for each other. 3 witnesses and the scribe (Bān&ucirc;nu/Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir//Rab-ban&ecirc;). Addendum: Previous promissory notes (<em>scil</em>. DCEPHE435 and VAT97) of <strong>A</strong> against <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> are invalid (<em>hep&ucirc;</em>, <em>hupp&ucirc;</em>).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāhu; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nādin//Nappāhu; <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Maqartu/Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir//Nappāhu<br /> &nbsp;"
