paraphrase: "Exchange of houses: <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> exchange houses in the &Scaron;uanna district of Babylon. <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s house comprises 2;0.2.4 sq. r on the upper side on the west, next to the house of <strong>A</strong>, 2;0.2.4 sq. r on the lower side on the east, next to the narrow through-street (<em>sūqu qatnu āṣ&ucirc;</em>), 2;0.1.6 sq. r on the upper front on the north next to the exit (<em>mūṣ&ucirc;</em>) of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>, and 2;0.1.6 sq. r on the lower front on the south, next to the house of <strong>C<sub>2</sub> </strong>and next to a property belonging to the dowry of (<em>nudunn&ucirc;</em>) of <sup>f</sup><strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong>; i.e. a total of 5;0.0.10 sq. r (cf. VAT98). <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s house comprises 3;0.3.(3+5/6) sq. r on the upper side on the west, next to the narrow no-through street (<em>sūqu qatnu lā āṣ&ucirc;</em>), the exit of the houses, 3;.0.2.8 sq. r on the lower side on the east, next to the house of <strong>C<sub>4</sub></strong>, 3 sq. r on the upper front on the north, next to the narrow no-through street, and 3;.0.0.14 sq. r on the lower front on the south, next to the house of <strong>C<sub>5</sub></strong> (= total of 10;0.3.7 sq. r). Since <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s house is almost double the size of <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s, <strong>A</strong> pays 2/3;4 minas of silver per sq. r. Thus <strong>A</strong> pays 3;58 minas of block silver and additional 8 shekels for the clothing of the mistress of the house (&lt;<em>lu</em>&gt;-<em>ba</em>-<em>ri &scaron;a bēlet bīti</em>); i.e. 4;6 minas of silver in total. The document closes with the usual final: the money was received, further litigation on part of the party of <strong>B</strong> is excluded on pain of paying the price 12 times over, each party has taken a copy. 6 witnesses (<em>ina kanāk ṭuppi</em>), 1 <em>ina a&scaron;ābi</em>-witness (<sup>f</sup>Amat-Ninlil, wife of <strong>B</strong>), and the scribe (Libūru/Nab&ucirc;nnāya). Fingernail impressions of <strong>B</strong> are in place of a seal.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-rēmanni/Nab&ucirc;-bēl&scaron;unu//Rab-ban&ecirc;; <strong>B</strong> = Lābā&scaron;i/Kurbanni-Marduk//&Scaron;ama&scaron;-bāri; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Balāṭu/Kurbanni-Marduk//Rab-ban&ecirc;;<strong> C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bēl-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun/Nab&ucirc;-zēru-u&scaron;ab&scaron;i//At&ucirc;; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>3</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Lū-idiya/Nergal-u&scaron;allim//Egibi (but cf. VAT98 which gives: <sup>f</sup>Lū-idiya/Marduk(!)-u&scaron;allim//Egibi); <strong>C<sub>4</sub></strong> = Erībāya/Marduk-&scaron;umu-uṣur; <strong>C<sub>5</sub></strong> = &Scaron;ama&scaron;-&scaron;umu-lī&scaron;ir/Nādin//Pahāru<br /> &nbsp;"
