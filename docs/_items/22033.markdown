These are the capital amount and interest of the harvest of <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong>&rsquo;s field from the 23<sup>rd</sup> year. Addendum: each party has taken a copy. 4 witnesses and the scribe (&Scaron;ulum-Bābili/Zababa-pirˀ-uṣur).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = &Scaron;ellebu/Iddināya//Nappāhu; <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ina-Esagil-ram&acirc;t/Balāṭu; <strong>C</strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Zababa-iddin//Arad-Nergal<br /> &nbsp;"
