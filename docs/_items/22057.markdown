paraphrase: "Obligation to swear an oath (heavily damaged): The heavily damaged operative section seems to deal with the obligation of <strong>A</strong> to swear an oath before Mu&scaron;tē&scaron;ir-habli (the deified weapon of Marduk) by a certain date. A clause dealing with the penalty for failing to swear the oath is added. At least 3 witnesses and the scribe (Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-imbi//[...]-Bēl).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong>&nbsp;= [...]/Nādin<br /> &nbsp;"
