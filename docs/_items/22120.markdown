BM77513). <strong>A</strong> was present as a witness at the drawing up of the purchase tablet (<strong>A</strong> is not in the witness list of BM77513, but the first witness [Bēl-iddin/Nādin-ahi//Ma&scaron;tuk] and the scribe are). 2 witnesses and the scribe (Mu&scaron;allim-Marduk/&Scaron;ūzubu//Kānik-bābi).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-lī&scaron;ir/Zēru-ukīn//Ēṭiru; <strong>B</strong> = Lābā&scaron;i/Kurbanni-Marduk//&Scaron;ama&scaron;-bāri; <strong>C</strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāhu<br /> &nbsp;"
