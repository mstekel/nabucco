The reverse gives the ground plan of the plot with the south end, i.e. the right side of the tablet, damaged. The north end, whose upper side measures 15 &lceil;5/6&rceil;(?) <em>ammatu</em>, borders on the house of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>; the western end, whose lower side measures &lceil;16 2/3&rceil;(?) <em>ammatu</em>, borders on the house of <strong>B<sub>2;</sub></strong> and the eastern end, whose upper side measures 16 <em>ammatu</em>, borders on a narrow through-street (s<em>ūqu qaṭnu āṣ&ucirc;</em>). The total area amounts to 5;0.1.(13 &frac12;) sq.r (ca. 64 m&sup2;) (possibly connected to BM92796 and VAT384).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = [...]/Kurbanni-Marduk//[...]; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Marduk-&scaron;umu-uṣur; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = [...]/[...]<br /> &nbsp;"
