paraphrase: "Promissory note for dates: <strong>B</strong> owes to <strong>A</strong> 2;1 kor of dates, 10 loads of palm-frond ribs (<em>huṣābu</em>), 1 container of pressed dates (<em>darīku</em>), the remainder of yield of the plot (<em>ebūr eqli</em>) &nbsp;from the 11<sup>th</sup> year of Darius. He is to pay it in Arahsamnu (VIII) in [Babyl]on. <strong>B</strong> is paid the dates of corv&eacute;e labour (<em>dullu</em>) and the levy of the agricultural supervisor (<em>gugallu</em>). A damaged passage follows concerning the witnessing of an illegible act in the 12<sup>th</sup> year of Darius and the statement against having cut [(something) ...] and that evidence thereof will be provided. [beginning of rev. lost] 2 witnesses extant and the scribe (Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-apli//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Nergal).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāhu;<strong> B</strong> = Balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-bālti-ilī//Atkuppu<br /> &nbsp;"
