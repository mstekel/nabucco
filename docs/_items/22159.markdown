The debt will bear a monthly interest of 1 shekel per mina.<strong> B </strong>and his brothers originally owed the silver to <strong>C</strong>, their creditor. <strong>D</strong> paid <strong>C </strong>on their behalf (<em>ana muhhi&scaron;u u ana muhhi ahhē&scaron;u</em>). <strong><sup>f</sup>A </strong>in turn paid <strong>D</strong>. The house of <strong>B</strong>, bordering on that of Libluṭ/Ibnāya//As&ucirc;, and his possessions (<em>mimma&scaron;u gabbi</em>) are pledged.<br /> Three witnesses and the scribe (Ṭāb-ṣilli-Marduk//Rab-ban&ecirc;). According to the partly restored VAT1961+ <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> is the mother of <strong>B</strong> and his brothers.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A </strong>= <sup>f</sup>&Scaron;idatu/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāḫu; <strong>B </strong>= Bēl-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun/Nab&ucirc;-nādin-&scaron;umi//Gaḫul; <strong>C </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-tabni-uṣur/Balāṭu; <strong>D </strong>= Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāḫu (brother of <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong>)<br /> &nbsp;"
