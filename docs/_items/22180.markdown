paraphrase: "Lease of a house: <strong>A</strong> rents his house to <strong>B</strong> for yearly 18 shekels of white, unstamped cut silver of 1/8 alloy for two years. The house is next to those of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>. He is to renew (<em>&scaron;an&ucirc;</em>) the roof (<em>ūru</em>) and repair (<em>batqa ṣabātu</em>) the drain (<em>asurr&ucirc;</em>). In Nisannu (I), D&ucirc;zu (IV) and Kislīmu (IX) he is to make additional payments (<em>nūptu</em>). It is at his disposal from the 1<sup>st</sup> of Simānu (III). <strong>B</strong> may charge (<em>man&ucirc;</em>) any costs for the work on the bricks, reeds and roof-beams in silver to <strong>A</strong>. <strong>A</strong> provides him with bricks, reeds and roof-beams for the repairs. <strong>A</strong> receives as the instalment from the beginning of the year 10 shekels of white cut silver. Addendum: Each party has taken a copy. 5 witnesses and the scribe (Bēl-nāˀid/Nergal-u&scaron;allim/Kānik-bābi). Addendum: <strong>B </strong>may not charge to <strong>A </strong>the hire of a builder due to the altered rent.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong>&nbsp;= Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāhu; <strong>B</strong>&nbsp;= Nab&ucirc;-mu&scaron;ētiq-udd&ecirc;/&Scaron;āpik-zēri//Miṣirāya; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ittannu/Marduk-zēru-ibni//Esagilāya; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nanāya-iddin<br /> &nbsp;"
