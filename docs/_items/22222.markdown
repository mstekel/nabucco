paraphrase: "Additional payment in connection with purchase of singer&rsquo;s prebend: <strong>B</strong> gives back to <strong>A</strong> (further) 2 shekels of silver, after he had bought the prebend before I&scaron;hara of the 8<sup>th</sup> of Nisannu (I), comprising rights to 1 head of an ox, 1 <em>lā ill&ucirc;</em> head of a sheep and the (non-choice?) <em>lā ill&ucirc; habsurukku</em>-joint, from <strong>A</strong> for the full price (i.e. 16 shekels of silver, cf. BM77551+). It is further stated that <strong>C</strong> was present as a witness at the drawing up of the purchase tablet (BM77551+), possibly as an appendix to the witness list of that tablet as he is not listed in the witness list there. 8 witnesses + 4 added afterwards, and the scribe (= <strong>A</strong>).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-rēmanni/Kidinnu(=Kidin-Marduk)//Bēl-eṭēri; <strong>B</strong> = &Scaron;ellebu/Iddināya//Nappāhu; <strong>C</strong> = Erība-Marduk/Nab&ucirc;-nāṣir//Bēl-eṭēri<br /> &nbsp;"
