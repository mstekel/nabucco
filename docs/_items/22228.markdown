paraphrase: "Obligation to bring tablet: <strong>B</strong> is to give to <strong>A </strong>the tablet concerning the exchange of real estate (<em>qan&acirc;tu</em>) with <strong>C</strong> (cf. VAT67), which bears drawings (<em>&scaron;a ṣalmāni</em>), by the 10<sup>th</sup> of Ulūlu (VI), 2<sup>nd</sup> year of Cyrus. In case the tablet is not handed over, B has to clear himself with an oath. Then it is stated that <strong>B</strong> gave a copy of said tablet to <strong>A</strong>. 2 witnesses and the scribe (Iddin-Bēl/Aqara//Sipp&ecirc;).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāhu; <strong>B</strong> = Lābā&scaron;i/Kurbanni-Marduk//&Scaron;ama&scaron;-bāri; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-rēmanni/Nab&ucirc;-bēl&scaron;unu//Rab-ban&ecirc;<br /> &nbsp;"
