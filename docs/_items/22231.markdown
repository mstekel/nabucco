paraphrase: "Lease of a house: <strong>B</strong>&nbsp;rents his house to <strong>A</strong>, which is next to the no-through street (<em>sūqu lā āṣ&ucirc;</em>, <em>la</em>-<em>ṣu</em>-&lceil;<em>&uacute;</em>&rceil;) and the thoroughfare of Nab&ucirc; and Nanāya, for a yearly rent of 18 shekels of cut silver of 1/8 alloy for five years. <strong>A</strong> is to renew (<em>&scaron;an&ucirc;</em>) the roof and carry out repairs (<em>batqa ṣabātu</em>). In Nisannu (I), D&ucirc;zu (IV) and Kislīmu (IX) he is to make additional payments (<em>nūptu</em>). However, he may charge (<em>man&ucirc;</em>) to <strong>B</strong> any cost of his work on the bricks (<em>libittu</em>), the reeds (<em>qan&acirc;tu</em> and the roof (<em>ūru</em>) exceeding 1 shekel of silver. <strong>B</strong> is to deliver half of the payments at the beginning of the year and the remainder in the middle. The house will be at <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s disposal from the 1<sup>st</sup> of month [x] for five years. The tablet closes with a clause against transgression on pain of paying 1 mina of white silver. Addendum: each party has taken a copy. 6 witnesses and the scribe (Bēl-uballiṭ/Rēmut-Bēl//Dābibī).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-eṭēri-Nab&ucirc;/Būr-idrī; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāhu<br /> &nbsp;"
