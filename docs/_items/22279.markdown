paraphrase: "Lease of prebendary duties (heavily damaged): Only a few meat items of income of certain days, of the 4<sup>th</sup> and the 17<sup>th</sup> day can be perceived on the heavily damaged obverse of the tablet. <strong>A</strong> seems to be the lessee (given the expression <em>ana </em><strong>A</strong> [...] <em>iddin</em>) of the prebend. His duty extends [fr]om the 10<sup>th </sup>day to [x]. 3 witnesses and the scribe(?) ([...]/Iqūpu//&Scaron;umu-lib&scaron;i). The dating is lost apart from the damaged indication of the year.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = &Scaron;ellebu[/Iddin-Nab&ucirc;//Nappāhu]<br /> &nbsp;"
