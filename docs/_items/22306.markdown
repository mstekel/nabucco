paraphrase: "Receipt for barley: <strong>A</strong> receives from <strong>C</strong> on orders (<em>ina qību</em>) of <strong>B</strong> 18;1.4 kor of barley. This barley is of the bow-obligation of <strong>B</strong> which was given to <strong>C</strong>. Further, a promissory note (<em>u</em>ˀ<em>iltu</em>) was drawn up against <strong>C</strong> to the effect of him having to register (<em>izuzzu</em> &Scaron;) it in the writing board (<em>lēˀu</em>) of Bēl and give (proof of) it to <strong>D</strong>. Addendum: The barley of <strong>E</strong> owed by [an illegible party] is paid. 8 witnesses and the scribe (Lī&scaron;iru/Bazūzu).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= [...]/Niqūdu;<strong> B </strong>= Ubāru/Nādin//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-I&scaron;tar-Bābili; <strong>C</strong>&nbsp;= Nab&ucirc;-aplu-iddin/Erība-Ea//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Nab&ucirc;; <strong>D</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-bullissu/Ubāru//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-I&scaron;tar-Bābili; <strong>E</strong> = Arad-Madānu<br /> &nbsp;"
