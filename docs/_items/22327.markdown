At least 4 witnesses and the scribe (Iddin-Nab&ucirc;//Ahhē-iddin). Addendum: The barley and dates correspond to the earlier documents.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Ina-ṣilli-Esagil/Zēria (the alphabet scribe [<em>sēpiru</em>]); <strong>B</strong> = Iddināya(=Iddin-Nab&ucirc;)/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāhu<br /> &nbsp;"
