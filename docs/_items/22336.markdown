paraphrase: "Lease of house: <strong>B</strong> rents to <strong>A</strong> his house which is next to that of <strong>C</strong>. The rent is 15 shekels of silver per year. <strong>A</strong> is to renew (<em>&scaron;an&ucirc;</em>) the roof and repair (<em>batqa ṣabātu</em>) the drain (<em>asurr&ucirc;</em>). In Nisannu (I), D&ucirc;zu (IV) and Kislīmu (IX) he is to make additional payments (<em>nūptu</em>). He is to pay half the silver at the beginning of the year and the rest in the middle. The house is his from the 1<sup>st</sup> of Ta&scaron;rītu (VII). Addendum: Each party has taken a copy. 2 witnesses and the scribe (Bēl-iddin/Tabn&ecirc;a//As&ucirc;).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-lū-salim/Iddin-Nab&ucirc;; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāhu; <strong>C</strong> = Ṭāb-ṣilli-Marduk/Balāṭu//Rab-ban&ecirc;<br /> &nbsp;"
