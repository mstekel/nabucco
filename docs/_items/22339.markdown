The house is next to the no-through street (<em>sūqu lā āṣ&ucirc;</em>) and the thoroughfare of Nab&ucirc; and Nanāya,&nbsp; the yearly rent amounts to 18 shekels of white cut silver of 1/8 alloy, the duration of the lease is three years. <strong>A</strong> is to pay half at the beginning of the year and the rest in the middle. <strong>A</strong> is to renew (<em>&scaron;an&ucirc;</em>) the roof and repair (<em>batqa ṣabātu</em>) the drain (<em>asurr&ucirc;</em>), the brickwork (<em>libittu</em>), reeds (<em>qan&acirc;tu</em>) and roof (<em>ūru</em>), for whose costs he may charge (<em>man&ucirc;</em>) <strong>B </strong>[further possible conditions are damaged]. <strong>B</strong> [receives the payment of the beginning of the year]. Addendum: Each party has taken a copy. 4 witnesses and the scribe (Bēl-bullissu/Nab&ucirc;-aplu-id[din]//Saggilāya)<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Mūrānu/Bēl-iddin//[...]; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāhu<br /> &nbsp;"
