paraphrase: "Receipt for house rent: <strong>A</strong> receives in payment from <strong>B</strong> the rent of his house for the months from Simānu (III) till Arahsamnu (VIII) of 10<sup>th</sup> year of Darius. Each party has taken a copy. 1 &frac12; shekels of white silver of <strong>B</strong> are at <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s disposal. 4 witnesses and the scribe (Mu&scaron;allim-Marduk/&Scaron;ūzubu//Kānik-bābi). A promissory oath (<em>k&icirc; ad&icirc;</em>) concerning repairs to the house by <strong>B </strong>follows at the end. (cf. MMA86.11.153).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong>&nbsp;= Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāhu; <strong>B</strong>&nbsp;= Nab&ucirc;-mu&scaron;ētiq-udd&ecirc;/&Scaron;āpik-zēri//Miṣirāya<br /> &nbsp;"
