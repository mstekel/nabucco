paraphrase: "Statement before witnesses: On the 10<sup>th</sup> of Ulūlu (VII) in the gate of the I&scaron;hara temple <strong>A</strong> states before witnesses that <strong>B</strong> was maligned (<em>qalālu</em>, <em>qullul</em>), had kept the watch (<em>maṣṣartu</em>) on behalf of <strong>C</strong> and did not abandon his post (<em>il-li-nim</em>, read[?]: <em>il-li-ik<sup>!</sup></em>, <em>alāku </em>[MA]). A list of 4 witnesses follows; no scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāhu; <strong>B</strong> = Arad-Nergal; <strong>C</strong> = Ha&scaron;dāya/Aplāya//Bēl-eṭēri<br /> &nbsp;"
