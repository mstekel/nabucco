paraphrase: "Lease of house: <strong>B</strong> rents to <strong>A</strong> his house which is next to that of <strong>C</strong>. The rent is 13 shekels of white cut silver of 1/8 alloy per year. <strong>A</strong> is to pay half of it at the beginning of the year and the rest in the middle. <strong>B</strong> has received the payment of the beginning of the year. <strong>A</strong> is to renew (<em>&scaron;an&ucirc;</em>) the roof and repair (<em>batqa ṣabātu</em>) the drain (<em>asurr&ucirc;</em>). In Nisannu (I), D&ucirc;zu (IV) and Kislīmu (IX) he is to make additional payments (<em>nūptu</em>). However, he may charge (<em>man&ucirc;</em>) to <strong>B</strong> any cost of his work exceeding 1 shekel of stamped (<em>ginnu</em>) silver. The house will be at <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s disposal from the 1<sup>st</sup> of Simānu (III) for two years. 3 witnesses and the scribe (Ardiya//Nab&ucirc;nnāya).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-bullissu/Nab&ucirc;-kāṣir//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāhu; <strong>C</strong> = Ṭāb-ṣilli-Marduk/Balāṭu//Rab-ban&ecirc;<br /> &nbsp;"
