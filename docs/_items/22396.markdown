paraphrase: "Lease of a house: <strong>B </strong>rents his house to <strong>A</strong>. The house is next to the broad street (<em>sūqu rap&scaron;u</em>), the thoroughfare of Nab&ucirc; and Nanāya, the yearly rent amounts to 1/3 mina of white cut silver of 1/8 alloy, the duration of the lease is three years.<strong> A</strong> is to pay half at the beginning of the year and the rest in the middle. He is to renew (<em>&scaron;an&ucirc;</em>) the roof and repair (<em>batqa ṣabātu</em>) the drain (<em>asurr&ucirc;</em>). And in Nisannu (I), D&ucirc;zu (IV) and Kislīmu (IX) he is to make additional payments (<em>nūptu</em>). However, he may charge (<em>man&ucirc;</em>) any costs for the repair works to <strong>B</strong>. The house is at <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s disposal from the 1<sup>st</sup> of Ulūlu (VI) of the 16<sup>th</sup> year. Addendum: Each party has taken a copy. 5 witnesses and the scribe (Bēl-ittannu/Nab&ucirc;-tabni-uṣur//Dābibī).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nuh&scaron;āya/Pālil-uballiṭ; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāhu<br /> &nbsp;"
