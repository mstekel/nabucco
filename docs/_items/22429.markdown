The chattels are said to correspond to <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s entire share in the dowry owed. Three witnesses, all descendents of Nappāḫu. Scribe: Qī&scaron;ti-Marduk/&Scaron;ūzubu//Kānik-bābi. Some markings (parallel lines) on lower edge<br /> <br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-nādin-&scaron;umi/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk//Gaḫal<br /> <strong>A<sub>2</sub> </strong>= fṢirāya/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāḫu<br /> <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāḫu"
