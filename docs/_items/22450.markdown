paraphrase: "Lease of a house: <strong>B</strong> rents to <strong>A</strong> his house next to the no-through street (<em>[sūqu lā</em>] <em>āṣ&ucirc;</em>) and the thoroughfare of Nab&ucirc; and Nanāya, for a yearly rent of 1/3 mina of white cut silver of 1/8 alloy for two years. <strong>A</strong> is to pay half at the beginning of the year and the rest in the middle. He is to renew (<em>&scaron;an&ucirc;</em>) the roof and repair (<em>batqa ṣabātu</em>) the drain (<em>asurr&ucirc;</em>). And in Nisannu (I), D&ucirc;zu (IV) and Kislīmu (IX) he is to make additional payments (<em>nūptu</em>). However, he may charge (<em>man&ucirc;</em>) <strong>B</strong> any cost of his work on the bricks (<em>libittu</em>), the reeds (<em>qan&acirc;tu</em>) and the roof (<em>ūru</em>) exceeding 1 shekel of silver. Each party has taken a copy. <strong>B</strong> receives the 10 shekels for his half-year. The document ends with a clause against transgression on pain of payment of 1 mina of white silver. 5 witnesses and the scribe (&Scaron;iriktu/Bēl-ēṭir). Addendum: The house is at <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s disposal from [day x month x year 18].<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;ullimanni, slave of Rēmūtu; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāhu<br /> &nbsp;"
