It is said that their accounts are settled (<em>qat&ucirc;</em>), but the levy of the agricultural supervisor (<em>gugallu</em>) and the guard&rsquo;s fee (<em>kādu</em>) are unpaid. A clause against pruning (<em>ar&ucirc; </em>D, <em>&uacute;-mar-ru</em>) any living part (<em>raṭbu</em>) (of the trees) follows. 2 witnesses and the scribe (Nergal-u&scaron;allim//Eppe&scaron;-ilī).
