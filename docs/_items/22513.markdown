paraphrase: "Promissory note for dates (obv. heavily damaged): The witnesses, the mention of <strong>B</strong> as the tenant and also of <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> &ndash; albeit in an unclear context &ndash; suggest that the subject of this tablet is similar to that of n VAT353, which concerns dates as impost on <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong>&rsquo;s field. 4 witnesses, including the scribe of VAT353 (Nab&ucirc;-aplu-iddin/Erība-Marduk//Rab-ban&ecirc;), and the scribe (Nab&ucirc;-iqī&scaron;anni/Marduk-bēl-zēri//&Scaron;umu-lib&scaron;i). The location, Kār-Nab&ucirc;, is further specified as nāru-&scaron;a-Ahhē-&scaron;ullim.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> =<sup> f</sup>Ina-Esagil-ram&acirc;t/Balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Balāṭu/Iddin-Bēl//S&icirc;n-dāˀin<br /> &nbsp;"
