paraphrase: "Receipt for dates(?) (heavily damaged): <strong>A</strong> receives from (?) <strong>B</strong> an illegible product in connection with a date-palm. The supposed dates come from 0;1.2 kor of land of <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>, which she shares with another person. [remainder of obv. and most of rev. lost]. Possibly at least 3 witnesses, no scribe legible.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāhu; <strong>B</strong> = [...]-aplu-iddin/Niqūdu//[...]; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ina-Esagil-ram&acirc;t/Balāṭu//Egibi<br /> &nbsp;"
