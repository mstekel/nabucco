paraphrase: "Concerning a widow&rsquo;s settlement: <strong>A</strong> establishes (<em>&scaron;akānu</em>; <em>il-ta-kan</em>) &frac12; mina of silver as the share of <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> in place of her rations (<em>kurrummatu</em>). <strong>A </strong>takes that silver from the promissory note (<em>uˀiltu</em>) for 1 mina 10 shekels of silver that is owed to <strong>C</strong> by <strong>D</strong>. As security <strong>C</strong> had taken the house of <strong>D</strong>, which now belongs to <strong>A</strong> who inherited the assets of <strong>C</strong> (cf. VAT116). The remainder of the 1 mina 10 shekels of silver belong to <strong>A</strong>. As long as <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> has not been paid her &frac12; mina of silver, she will live in the southern wing(?) of the said house. The eastern wing belongs to <strong>A</strong>. <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> also swears by I&scaron;tar of Babylon that she possesses nothing else than 1 copper brazier (<em>mu&scaron;ahhinu</em>), 1 copper cup (<em>kāsu</em>), 1 bed (<em>er&scaron;u</em>), 1 table (<em>pa&scaron;&scaron;ūru</em>) and a chair (<em>kuss&ucirc;</em>), 4 (<em>sic</em>) items belonging to <strong>C</strong>. And she does not conceal (<em>ana pa&scaron;īri &scaron;akānu</em>) any promissory notes from <strong>A</strong>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāhu; <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Tappa&scaron;&scaron;ar/Nab&ucirc;-mu&scaron;ētiq-udd&ecirc;/Nūr-S&icirc;n (wife of <strong>B</strong>; cf. Baker 2004, 32f. for filiation); <strong>C </strong>= Gimillu/Marduk-&scaron;umu-ibni//Nappāhu; <strong>D</strong> = Bēl-aplu-iddin/Dādiya/Rab-ban&ecirc;<br /> &nbsp;"
