paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver with house as security: <strong>B</strong> owes to <strong>A</strong> [x] minas of silver. The debt will bear a monthly interest of 1 shekel per mina from D&ucirc;zu (IV). <strong>A </strong>takes <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s house as security. This is apart from an earlier promissory note for which he took a house as security. 2 witnesses and the scribe (Arad-Gula/[Bēl-ahh]ē-iddin(?)//Nab&ucirc;nnāya).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nergal-[...]/Marduk-erība//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;; <strong>B</strong> = Iqī&scaron;āya/&Scaron;umu-iddin//Kutimmu<br /> &nbsp;"
