paraphrase: "Promissory note for dates (heavily damaged): <strong>A</strong> owes [x amount of dates]. He is to pay it [in Arahsamnu (VIII)] in the storehouse (<em>haṣāru</em>) in the <em>ma&scaron;īhu</em>-measure of 1 PI, together with 10 palm-leaf baskets (<em>tuhallu</em>), 10 date baskets (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>), [...], 10 loads of palm-frond ribs (<em>huṣābu</em>). This excludes 1;3.2 kor of dates of the 6<sup>th</sup> year and 0;2.3 kor of dates. The latter dates are in not further specifiable connection with <strong>B</strong>. The last legible clause speaks about confirming something of the 5<sup>th</sup> year in a promissory note (<em>uˀiltu</em>). [remainder of tablet lost].<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong>&nbsp;= [...]/[...]//Egibi; <strong>B</strong>&nbsp;= Bēl-&scaron;umu-uṣur<br /> &nbsp;"
