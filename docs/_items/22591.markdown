paraphrase: "Record of oath: <strong>B </strong>will give &frac12; mina of silver to <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> as it is written in the promissory note (<em>uˀiltu</em>; cf. VAT51), since she swears that she has not taken anything apart from the things mentioned in the said document. Furthermore <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> will not demand (<em>erē&scaron;u</em>) any rations (<em>kurrummatu</em>) of <strong>B</strong>. 3 witnesses, including the brother of <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> (Bēl-usāt/Niqudu[=Nab&ucirc;-mu&scaron;ētiq-udd&ecirc;]//Nūr-S&icirc;n), and the scribe(?) (Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Etellu//Egibi).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Tappa&scaron;&scaron;ar/Nab&ucirc;-mu&scaron;ētiq-udd&ecirc;//Nūr-S&icirc;n (cf. Baker 2004, 32f. for filiation); <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāhu<br /> &nbsp;"
