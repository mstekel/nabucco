paraphrase: "Record of dispute conducted before citizens (<em>mār ban&ecirc;</em>): <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> dispute over the prebend before Bēl-āliya-&scaron;a-&Scaron;arrabānu. <strong>B</strong> was not granted rights (<em>&scaron;ur&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) over the prebend. <strong>B</strong> says that his prebend is at the disposal of <strong>A</strong>, so <strong>A </strong>should give him the 10 shekels of silver that <strong>B</strong> had paid on his behalf to <strong>C</strong>. A list of 5 witnesses follows; no scribe. Rubrum: It is a notice (<em>tahsistu</em>) so as to not forget.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = &Scaron;ākin-&scaron;umi/Nadnāya//Nappāhu; <strong>B </strong>= Balāṭu/Marduk-erība//Nappāhu; <strong>C</strong> = Zūzāya<br /> &nbsp;"
