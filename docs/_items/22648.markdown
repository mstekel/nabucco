paraphrase: "Lease of prebendary duties (heavily damaged): the text concerns the rations and beer of the measurer&rsquo;s(?) prebend (<em>m</em>[<em>andidūtu</em>]) of I&scaron;hara. The prebendary service in question seems to begin with the 1<sup>st</sup> day of month [x].<br /> &nbsp;<br /> No protagonists are legible.<br /> &nbsp;"
