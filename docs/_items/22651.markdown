paraphrase: "Document concerning division of inheritance [damaged]: The fragmentary state of the tablet precludes an exact understanding of its terms. The text deals with the division of <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s inheritance among <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong>. The text seems to be mostly concerned with outstanding promissory notes (<em>uˀiltu</em>). In this context also <strong>C</strong> is mentioned. The tablet breaks off after the mention of a bed (<em>er&scaron;u</em>) and a brazier (<em>mu&scaron;ahhinu</em>). No witnesses or scribe extant.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Bēl-ahhē-erība/Nab&ucirc;-balāssu-iqbi//Nappāhu (son of <strong>B</strong>); <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = Iqī&scaron;a-Marduk/Nab&ucirc;-balāssu-iqbi//Nappāhu (son of <strong>B</strong>); <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong> = Bēl-ēṭir/Nab&ucirc;-balāssu-iqbi//Nappāhu (son of <strong>B</strong>); <strong>B = </strong>Nab&ucirc;-balāssu-iqbi/Mu&scaron;allim-Marduk//Nappāhu; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-ahhē-iqī&scaron;a<br /> &nbsp;"
