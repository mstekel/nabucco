paraphrase: "Note of credit arrangement by proxy: <strong>A</strong> draws up a promissory note (<em>uˀiltu</em>) against <strong>B</strong> at the behest of <strong>C</strong> for 5/6 mina 5 shekels of white cut silver of 1/8 alloy. The document stresses that the silver belongs to <strong>C</strong> and not to <strong>A</strong>. <strong>A</strong> is to register (<em>izuzzu </em>&Scaron;) the promissory note and give (proof of) it to <strong>C</strong>. 4 witnesses and the scribe (Nidintu-Marduk//Rab-ban&ecirc;).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong>&nbsp;= &Scaron;ellebu/Iddin-Nab&ucirc;//Nappāhu; <strong>B</strong> = Rēmūt-Nab&ucirc;/Ina-ṣilli-Bēl//Nuhā&scaron;u; <strong>C</strong> = Erībāya/Iddin-Nab&ucirc;//Nappāhu<br /> &nbsp;"
