paraphrase: "Transfer of a house as antichretic pledge.<br /> <br /> <strong>B</strong> pledges a house to <strong>A</strong> for two years as security for 1 1/3 minas of silver. The pledge is antichretic. Previously, <strong>B</strong> had taken the house as a pledge for the same amount of silver from <strong>C</strong>, with the additional injunction to rebuild the house (<em>&scaron;a &hellip; ak&icirc; &hellip; kaspi ma&scaron;kani u epē&scaron;i &scaron;a bīti ṣabtu</em>). The house is to be released to <strong>C</strong> only when <strong>C</strong> pays his debt to <strong>B</strong> and <strong>B</strong> subsequently clears his debt with <strong>A</strong>. The silver in question is said to be part of the dowry of <sup>f</sup>Zunnāya, daughter of Adad-zēru-ibni. The obligation for the delivery of the qinayyātu offerings is to be shared. The house borders on properties of Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-ibni/Rēmūtu//Sipp&ecirc; and Gimillu//Banāya.<br /> Four witnesses; scribe: Ea-&scaron;umu-uṣur/Nab&ucirc;-zēru-lī&scaron;ir//Rēˀ&ucirc;. The tablet displays a geometrical drawing on the left edge.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri/Bēl-kāṣir//Nappāḫu; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-aḫḫē-iddin/Būr-Adad//Itinnu; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-lī&scaron;ir/Balassu//Gallābu"
