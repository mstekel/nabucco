paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver with pledge of a slave, partly damaged. <strong>B</strong> and his brothers owe an unknown sum of silver to <strong>A</strong>; <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s slave Bēl-lūmur is given to <strong>A</strong> as an antichretic pledge. The debtors&rsquo; mother <sup>f</sup>&Scaron;idātu/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri//Nappāḫu acts as a guarantor. The debt results from a tax payment made by <strong>A</strong> on behalf of <strong>B</strong> and his brothers to an unnamed <em>rab ḫan&scaron;&icirc;</em> (commander of fifty). The four witnesses include as first witness <sup>f</sup>&Scaron;idātu&rsquo;s father Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zīri//Nappāḫu (partly restored).<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-tabni-uṣur/Balāṭu//Egibi (filiation restored); <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun/Nab&ucirc;-nādin-&scaron;umi//Gaḫal (partly restored)"
