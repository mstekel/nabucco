paraphrase: "Settlement of a dispute:<strong> A</strong> has returned and handed over to <strong>B </strong>(<em>t&acirc;ru-nadānu</em>) the document of the oath (<em>&scaron;aṭāru</em> <em>&scaron;a</em> <em>tamīti</em>), which he has drawn up together with <strong>B</strong> on the present day. They mutually finished (<em>qat&ucirc;</em>) their former argument (<em>dibbu</em>). Where the document appears (<em>amāru</em> N-stem), it belongs to <strong>B</strong>. 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Bēl/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-ukīn//Kidin-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-uṣur&scaron;u/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl//Ea-ilūtu-bāni; Scribe = Nab&ucirc;-uṣur&scaron;u/Libluṭ//&Scaron;a-1-luh<br /> &nbsp;"
