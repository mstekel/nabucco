paraphrase: "Lease of a house: <strong>B</strong> will dwell in the house of <strong>A</strong>, bordering the house of <strong>C</strong>, for the yearly rent of 10 shekels of silver. <strong>B</strong> guarantees (<em>pūtu na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) for the repair (<em>batqu ṣabātu</em>) of the <em>azmar&ucirc;</em> (= lance?) of [&hellip;]. If he dwells in the house for two years, he will also renew the roof (<em>ūru &scaron;an&ucirc;</em>). If he dwells in the house for only one year, he will renew half (<em>ahu</em>) of the roof. 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Zēr-Bābili/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun//(Ea-)ilūtu-bāni; <strong>B</strong> = Ṣillāya/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk//Rī&scaron;āya; <strong>C</strong> = Lī&scaron;ir//Huṣābu; Scribe = <strong>B</strong><br /> &nbsp;"
