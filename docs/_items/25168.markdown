paraphrase: "Work contract: From the 1<sup>st</sup> of D&ucirc;zu (IV) until the 1<sup>st</sup> of Abu (V) <strong>A</strong> is enrolled into service with <strong>B</strong> (<em>itti</em> PN <em>uzuzzu</em> &Scaron;-stem). <strong>B</strong> will give to <strong>A</strong> firewood (<em>huṣābu</em>) from his own (assets). <strong>B</strong> will enjoy (<em>akālu</em>) half share (<em>ahi zitti</em>) with <strong>A </strong>(in the profits of the joint venture). They will pay for the rent (<em>idū</em>) of the harbour (<em>kāru</em>) from their undivided property (<em>kar&ucirc;</em>). As much as <strong>B</strong> will manufacture (<em>epē&scaron;u</em>, propably referring to the manufacture of bricks, see Joann&egrave;s 1989: 143), he will take away (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>). On the contrary, <strong>A</strong> will not take away anything from (<em>ina libbi</em>) what <strong>B</strong> manufactures. 3 witnesses (including Mu&scaron;ēzib/Zēr-Bābili//(Ea-)ilūtu-bāni) and the scribe. The one who violates (<em>nabalkutu</em>) the contract will pay 1 shekel of silver.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nuhhu-Anim, <em>qallu</em> (slave) of Zēr-Bābili/(Ea-)ilūtu-bāni; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-alsi-ul-abā&scaron;, <em>qallu</em> (slave) of Ṣillāya/Rī&scaron;āya; Scribe = Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-apli/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-iddin//Arkāt-ilāni<br /> &nbsp;"
