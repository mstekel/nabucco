paraphrase: "Final settlement of a dispute concerning land: This record documents the settlement of a dispute concerning a plot of arable land planted with date palms (<em>zēru gi&scaron;immarē zaqpu</em>), located between the marsh (<em>raqqatu</em>) and the wasteland (<em>ki&scaron;ubb&ucirc;</em>), part of the meadowland (<em>ugāru</em>) of the city of Ṭabānu in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Borsippa. On the 12<sup>th</sup> of Nisān (I) of Darius 31<sup>st</sup> year <strong>A</strong> put a claim (<em>paqāru</em> <em>&scaron;akānu</em>) on this land against (<em>ina muhhi</em>) <strong>B</strong>. On the 2<sup>nd</sup> of Ayyār (II) of the same year<strong> A </strong>paid the full price of 7 minas and 17 &frac12; shekels of white scrap silver (<em>kaspu peṣ&ucirc; nuhhutu</em>) by 1/8 alloy silver (<em>bitqu</em>) per shekel, but <strong>B</strong> did not transfer the land. Now it was decided that <strong>B</strong> will give back the full amount of silver to <strong>A</strong>. In return <strong>A</strong> will give <strong>B</strong> a tablet of the dispute (<em>ṭuppi dīni</em>) and (the promise) of not lodging a claim (<em>ragāmu</em>) to the field (<em>eqlu</em>) for whose arable land <strong>B</strong> will give <strong>A</strong> and his brothers 1 2/3 mina 7 &frac12; shekels of silver, remainder (<em>rēhtu</em>) of the price of the field. The dispute is settled in the presence of (<em>ina mahar</em>) 2 judges (<em>dayyānu</em>) (Mu&scaron;allim-Marduk//Rēmūt-Bēl and Bēl-ittannu//Bēl-eṭēru) and 2 scribes (<em>ṭup&scaron;arru</em>) (Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl//Egibi and Arad-Nab&ucirc;//Rē&rsquo;i-sis&ecirc;). Four seal impressions.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-erība/Rēmūt-Bēl//[&hellip;]; <strong>B</strong> = Ahu&scaron;unu/Nab&ucirc;-mu&scaron;ētiq-uddi//Nanāhu<br /> &nbsp;"
