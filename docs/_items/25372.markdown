It ranges from the front of the Canal of the [&hellip;] Palace to the dyke (<em>kil&acirc;tu</em>) of the <em>han&scaron;&ucirc;</em>-land. Its upper side borders on Hahhūru and its lower side on (the house of) <strong>C</strong>. The land is cultivated by a group of slaves (<em>amīlūtu</em>) headed by <strong>D</strong> who shall not be divided (<em>z&acirc;zu</em>).
