Broken passage and another broken passage saying that [&hellip;] received from <strong>B</strong> and <strong>B</strong> received in full (<em>mahāru</em>-<em>eṭēru</em>) from <strong>A</strong>. 3 witnesses and the scribe (not specified). Each party has taken a copy. Another broken clause.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Ahu&scaron;unu/Nab&ucirc;-mu&scaron;ētiq-uddi//Nanāhu; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Bēl-ēṭir//Nanāhu; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-zēru-ukīn/Nādinu//Raksu; <strong>D</strong> = Ṣillāya; Scribe = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-bulliṭ/Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir-nap&scaron;āti//Egibi<br /> &nbsp;"
