paraphrase: "Lease of a house: Beginning with the 15th of the present month <strong>A</strong> rents out to <strong>B</strong> for 4 years a house adjoining the house of <strong>C</strong> for 6 shekels of silver rent per year. The tenant is responsible for the renewing of the north wing (<em>bīt i&scaron;tāni</em>) until Ta&scaron;rīt (VII). The costs for it will be covered by the rent (<em>idū</em>) of the house. For any other work he performs (<em>epē&scaron;u</em>) in the house, the tenant can withhold (<em>kal&ucirc;</em> D-stem) the expenditure (<em>tēlītu</em>) and charge (<em>man&ucirc;</em>) his landlord with it. At the sealing of the tablet (<em>ṭuppu</em>) 2 witnesses (including Kidin-Marduk/Nab&ucirc;-balāssu-iqbi//Eppē&scaron;-ilī) and the scribe. Broken additional clause about the access of the landlord to the house.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun/Puhhuru//Ea-ilūtu-bāni; <strong>B</strong> = Silim-Bēl/&Scaron;umāya//Eppe&scaron;-ilī; <strong>C</strong> = Rēmūtu/&Scaron;a-p&icirc;-Bēl//Kānik-bābi; Scribe = Marduk-&scaron;umu-lib&scaron;i<br /> &nbsp;"
