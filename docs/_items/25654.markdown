paraphrase: "Exchange of land:<strong> A</strong> receives from <strong>B</strong> 0;2 square kor (5,400 m<sup>2</sup>) of arable land (<em>zēru</em>) forming part of the <em>han&scaron;&ucirc;</em>-land of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>. Its upper side and its lower side border on (property already owned by) <strong>A</strong>. Furthermore, the upper side as well as the upper front border on a plot of land within a measured area (<em>libbū eqli</em>). The lower side also borders on the marsh (<em>raqqatu</em>) of Aṣūnu. In exchange for his land, <strong>B</strong> receives 20 shares of <em>han&scaron;&ucirc;</em>-land of <strong>C<sub>2 </sub></strong>located in the irrigation district (<em>tamirtu</em>) Guraˀbi. The transaction is concluded before (<em>ina mahar</em>) the governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>) of Borsippa (Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-uṣur//Ilia) and the bishop (<em>&scaron;atammu</em>) of Ezida (Nab&ucirc;-nādin-&scaron;umi//Nūr-Papsukkal). Though no titles are given along the two individuals, their identification as governor and bishop respectively is clear. 5 witnesses (including Arad-Sutīti, the father of <strong>A</strong>) and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Puhhuru/Arad-Sutīti//Ilūtu-bāni; <strong>B </strong>= Marduk-&scaron;arrāni//Ilia, <em>&scaron;āpir sirā&scaron;āni</em> (overseer of the brewers); <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>= Bēl&scaron;unu//Da[&hellip;]; <strong>C<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Sup&ecirc;-Bēl//Ilūtu-bāni; Scribe = Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;ākin-&scaron;umi//Arkāt-ilāni-damqāti<br /> &nbsp;"
