paraphrase: "Administrative document concerning the distribution of a total of 4 &frac12; minas and 6 shekels of silver among 7 individuals including Nab&ucirc;-[...]/&Scaron;umu-uṣur//(Ea-)ilūtu-bāni and Zēr-Bābili/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun//(Ea-)ilūtu-bāni. The silver is qualified <em>&scaron;a ultu kisal</em>(<em>li</em>)<em> hīṭu</em> the meaning of which is obscure (&ldquo;from the courtyard&rdquo;(?), and perhaps relate <em>hīṭu</em> to <em>hāṭu</em> &ldquo;cash payment, private expenses (for supplies e.g.)&rdquo;, courtesy of K. Abraham).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;"
