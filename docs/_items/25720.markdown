paraphrase: "Purchase of a garden:<strong> A</strong> purchases a half share (<em>ahu</em>) of a date garden (<em>kir&icirc;</em> <em>gi&scaron;immari</em>) for 2 &frac12; minas of silver, together with an additional payment (<em>atru</em>) of 5 shekels of silver, from <strong>B<sub>1</sub> </strong>and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> (<strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s mother). The sold garden belongs to <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> (the [deceased] father of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>) and is located in the district (<em>erṣetu</em>) of the Ninurta Temple inside of Uruk. Its upper side borders on the city wall (<em>dūr āli</em>), its lower side on the house of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>, its upper front on the street (<em>sūqu</em>) and its lower front on (the property of) <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>. No cardinal directions are given in the record. Its upper side measures 300 cubits (150 m), its lower side and upper front 240 cubits (120 m) and its lower front 190 cubits (95 m). The plot presumably is the second half of the land bought by <strong>A</strong> from <strong>B<sub>1</sub> </strong>and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> one year earlier (BM118979). The transaction is concluded in the presence of (<em>ina uzuzzi</em>) the governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>) of Uruk (Ahhē&scaron;āya) and the bishop (<em>&scaron;atammu</em>) of Eanna (Balāṭu). 14 witnesses and the scribe. Fingernail impressions (<em>ṣupru</em>) of sellers.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Kiribtu; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Bēl-ahhē-iddin/Kudurru; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nasqat; <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> = Kudurru/Nab&ucirc;-ahu-ēre&scaron;; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Zākiru, <em>a&scaron;kāpu</em> (leatherworker); <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Zibāya//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Ninurta; Scribe = Bēl-īpu&scaron;//&Scaron;ama&scaron;-bāri<br /> &nbsp;"
