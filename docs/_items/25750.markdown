paraphrase: "The obverse of this tablet is destroyed. On its reverse the curse formula and the witness list, enumerating 8 individuals and the scribe &Scaron;ama&scaron;-erība//Ninurta-uballiṭ, are preserved. The curse formula suggests that the original document recorded a sale.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;"
