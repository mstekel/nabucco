The sold land is located in the district (<em>erṣetu</em>) of the Gula Gate inside Nippur. Its upper side (in the north), with a street (<em>sūqu</em>) lying inbetween (<em>ina bīri&scaron;unu</em>), borders on (the property of) <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and its lower side (in the south) on (the property of) <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>. Its upper front (in the east) borders on the &Scaron;alla Canal and its lower front (in the west) on (the property of) the seller <strong>B, </strong>which is a plot of land within a measured area (<em>libbū eqli</em>).
