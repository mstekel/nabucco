paraphrase: "Dialogue document concerning a self-adoption (during times of siege): The first 5 lines of the tablet are broken. The preserved text starts with the approach of <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> towards <strong>A</strong>, who asks <strong>A</strong> to feed her and take her as his slave. <strong>A</strong> grants the request and determines her maintenance costs (<em>kurummatu</em>). In case her husband, her son, her brother or another relative would like to redeem (<em>paṭāru</em>) <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong>, he has to replace her in equal terms. Curse formula. 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Aplāya//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Sippar; <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Maqartu; Scribe = &Scaron;ākin-&scaron;umi//&Scaron;a-nā&scaron;i&scaron;u<br /> <br /> &nbsp;"
