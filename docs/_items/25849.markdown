paraphrase: "Settlement of a dispute concerning a pledged house: Law case concerning a house which <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>, the guarantor (<em>māhiṣ pūti</em>), has pledged to <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, creditor in an interest-bearing loan (<em>hubullānu</em>) of 2 minas of silver, to <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>, the brother of<strong> C<sub>2</sub></strong>. When <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, the son of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, on the basis of a sealed document (<em>ṭuppu kī</em> <em>kanāku</em>), claims his rights on the said house, <strong>A</strong> asserts that the house was already pledged to him. Following the decision of the assembly (<em>puhru</em>) of the Babylonians and the governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>), <strong>A</strong> paid the 2 minas of silver to <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> and in return received a sealed document (<em>kunukku</em>). Now, the house, as a pledge, is only at the disposal of <strong>A</strong>. 5 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Kiribtu/S&icirc;n-nāṣir; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Kunāya//Basia; <strong>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir (A)/Kunāya/Basia; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = &Scaron;ulāya//Ṭābia; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir (B)//Ṭābia; Scribe = Marduk-nāṣir//Mudammiq-Adad<br /> &nbsp;"
