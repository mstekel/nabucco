The transaction is concluded in the presence of (<em>ina u&scaron;uzzi</em>) the governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>) of Uruk (Nab&ucirc;-udammiq) and the bishop (<em>&scaron;atammu</em>) of Eanna (Gimillu). 2 witnesses&nbsp; and the scribe, also defined as writer of the tablet (<em>&scaron;aṭir ṭuppi</em>).
