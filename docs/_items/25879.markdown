The sold land is located in the district (<em>erṣetu</em>) of the Gate of LUGAL.GU(D).SI.S&Aacute; inside of Nippur. Its upper side (in the north) borders on a house of <strong>A</strong> and its upper front (in the west) on the house of <strong>C</strong>. Its lower side (in the south) and its lower front (in the east) border on the plot of land within a measured area (<em>libbū eqli</em>). It measures 31 x 2 cubits (15.5 x 1 m). 13 witnesses and the scribe, also identified as the writer of the tablet (<em>&scaron;āṭir ṭuppi</em>).
