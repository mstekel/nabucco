The debt is free of interest (<em>hubuttūtu</em>) until the midst of Nisān (I) of the following year (&Scaron;&scaron;u 19). If <strong>B</strong> fails to pay by then, the amount of silver will be added to the sum <strong>A</strong> invested in the same business partnership (<em>harrānu</em>). 1 square kor of arable land (<em>zēru</em>) of <strong>B</strong>, located beneath the Canal (<em>harru</em>) of Ahhē-&scaron;ullim, as well as 294+ square cubits (c. 73.5 m2) of the house of <strong>B</strong> are placed as a pledge. 3 witnesses (including Nab&ucirc;-gāmil and his son Nādinu of the Ṭābihu family) and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-u&scaron;allim//Lēˀ&ecirc;a; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-nāṣir//Ṭābihu; Scribe = Nab&ucirc;-nāṣir/[&hellip;]<br /> &nbsp;"
