paraphrase: "Purchase of a house in Uruk:<strong> A</strong> purchases a ruined house (<em>bītu abtu</em>) for 4 minas of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>) from <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>. The sold house is the property of <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> whose relation to <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> remains unclear, and is located in the Eanna district (<em>erṣet Eanna</em>) inside Uruk. Its upper side (in the north) borders on a dead-end street (<em>sūqu lā āṣ&ucirc;</em>) as well as the house of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and its lower side (in the south) on the thoroughfare (<em>mūtaqu</em>) of the god and the king. Its upper front (in the west) borders on the house of <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> and its lower front (in the east) on the house(s) belonging to <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong>. No side lengths are given in the record. The transaction is concluded in the presence of (<em>ina uzuzzi</em>) the governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>) of Uruk (Ahhē&scaron;āya). 8 witnesses and the scribe, also defined as writer of the tablet (<em>&scaron;āṭir ṭuppi</em>). Fingernail impression (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Kiribtu; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Iddin-Marduk//&Scaron;umāya; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Dumqāya/&Scaron;ullumāya; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Huddāya/Kukul; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Kīnāya/Nādin-aplu; <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-u&scaron;ar&scaron;i/Ahhūtu; Scribe = Nab&ucirc;-zēru-iqī&scaron;a//Dayyānu<br /> &nbsp;"
