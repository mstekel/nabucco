paraphrase: "Purchase of a garden:<strong> A</strong> purchases a date garden (<em>kir&icirc;</em> <em>gi&scaron;immari</em>) for 2 &frac12; minas of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), together with an additional payment (<em>atru</em>) of one <em>talbultu</em>-garment, from <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>. The purchase price corresponds to the claim (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) towards <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, the father of the seller, and, hence, is in fact not handed over; instead the garden serves as compensation. The transferred garden is located in the district (<em>erṣetu</em>) of the royal canal (<em>nār</em> <em>&scaron;arri</em>) in the meadowland (<em>ugāru</em>) of Uruk. Its upper side borders on (the property of) <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>, its lower side on (the property of) <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> and its lower front on <em>han&scaron;&ucirc;</em>-land. Its upper front, which measures 230 cubits (115 m), follows the royal canal (<em>nār &scaron;arri</em>). No cardinal directions are given in the record. 17 witnesses and the scribe. Fingernail impression (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller. . The same type of procedure is recorded in BM118982.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-ibni/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-īpu&scaron;; <strong>B<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Bēl-ahhē-erība/Ahhē; <strong>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Ahhēa/Zabdānu; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-nāṣir; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-lēˀi/Marduk; Scribe = Kidin-Marduk//(&Scaron;a)-rē&scaron;-ummāni<br /> &nbsp;"
