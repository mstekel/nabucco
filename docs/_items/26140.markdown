paraphrase: "Court decision in Babylon: <strong>A<sub>1</sub> </strong>and <strong>A<sub>2</sub> </strong>bring a lawsuit against <strong>B </strong>before the assembly (<em>puhru</em>) of the citizens of Babylon concerning the prebend (<em>isqu</em>) of the cella (<em>bīt papāhi</em>) of the &Scaron;ama&scaron; Temple in Sippar which is patrimonial property of <strong>B</strong>. While they claim that they bought (<em>k&icirc; kaspi mahāru</em>) the prebend for 2 minas and 11 shekels of silver, <strong>B</strong> states that he only received 1 mina and 9 shekels of silver from <strong>C</strong> and <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>. Following the decision of the assembly, <strong>B</strong> weighed out and paid (<em>h&acirc;ṭu nadānu</em>) 1 mina and 9 shekels of silver to the claimants. For the remainder of 1 mina and 2 shekels of silver <strong>B</strong> has to take an oath (<em>tamītu</em>) at a temple (details are broken). Broken witness list and the scribe (name broken).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub> </strong>= Bēl-iddin; <strong>A<sub>2</sub> </strong>= Marduk; <strong>B</strong> = &Scaron;umu-iddin//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;; <strong>C</strong> = Murānu<br /> &nbsp;"
