paraphrase: "Purchase of fallow land: The temple of I&scaron;tar of Uruk and Nanāya purchases three fallow fields for 87 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>) from the two brothers <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, sons of <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> who is the actual owner of the field. The sold land is located in the district (<em>erṣetu</em>) of the &Scaron;ama&scaron; Gate inside Uruk. The transaction is concluded in the presence of (<em>ina u&scaron;uzzi</em>) the royal resident (<em>qīpu</em>) of Eanna (&Scaron;ama&scaron;-ilāya) and the scribe of Eanna (&Scaron;irikti-Marduk/Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;allim//Hunzu&rsquo;). 6 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-apli/Zērūtu; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Tabnēa/Zērūtu; <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> = Zērūtu/&Scaron;ulāya; Scribe = Marduk-&scaron;umu-uṣur/Nergal-nāṣir//Mudammiq-Adad"
