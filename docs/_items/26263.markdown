paraphrase: "Dialogue document concerning the purchase of a girl during the siege of Nippur in S&icirc;n-&scaron;umu-lē&scaron;ir 3rd year (when 0,0.1 kor (6 l) of barley costs 1 shekel of silver and people were forced to sell their children): <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> approaches <strong>A</strong> and asks to lead away (<em>abāku</em>) and keep alive (<em>bulluṭu</em>) her daughter <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> for the exact price (<em>&scaron;īm</em> <em>hariṣ</em>) of 6 shekels of silver. <strong>A</strong> accepts <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong>&rsquo;s offer and hands over the money. In case of transgressors (<em>sēh&ucirc;</em>) or claimants (<em>pāqirānu</em>) of <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> has to either replace <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> or hand over the revenue for <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>. Witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Ninurta-uballiṭ/Bēl-usāti; <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> = Gugalla; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = Riˀindu<br /> <br /> &nbsp;"
