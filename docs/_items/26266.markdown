paraphrase: "Purchase of wasteland:<strong> A</strong> purchases 196 square cubits (c. 48.96 m2; for the measuring unit <em>nikkas qan&ucirc;</em> see comment in San Nicolo 1951: 9) of wasteland (<em>eqlu ki&scaron;ubb&ucirc;</em>) for [x] amounts of silver from <strong>B</strong>. The sold land is located in the district (<em>erṣetu</em>) of the New Town inside of Babylon. Its upper side (in the west) borders on the wide street (<em>sūqu rap&scaron;u</em>), the thoroughfare (<em>mūtaqu</em>) of the god and the king, and its lower side (in the east) borders on the house of <strong>C</strong>. Its upper front (in the north) borders on the house of the buyer <strong>A</strong> and its lower front (in the south) on the passage (<em>mūṣ&ucirc;</em>) of <strong>C</strong>. Its upper and lower side each measure 28 cubits (14 m), its upper front 15 cubits (7.5 m) and its lower front 16.5 cubits (8.25 m). 8(+) witnesses and the scribe. Instead of a seal impression (<em>kunukku</em>), fingernail impression (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Ina-tē&scaron;&icirc;-ēṭir//[&hellip;] (forms probably part of the Basia family; see Nielsen 2011: 62, fn. 189); <strong>B</strong> = Marduk//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Nergal-ēṭir//Basia; Scribe = Marduk-&scaron;arrani//S&icirc;n-nāṣir"
