paraphrase: "Partly broken purchase of a ruined house:<strong> A</strong> purchases from <strong>B</strong> a ruined house (<em>bītu abtu</em>) for [x] amounts of silver. The sold house is located inside of Uruk (further details broken). On each side it borders on other houses whose owners are not preserved. The transaction is concluded in the presence of (<em>ina u&scaron;uzzi</em>) the governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>) of Uruk (Ahhē&scaron;āya) and the bishop (<em>&scaron;atammu</em>) of Eanna (Balāṭu). 7 witnesses (+ an additional witness added at the end of the tablet) and the scribe, also defined as writer of the tablet (<em>&scaron;āṭir ṭuppi</em>). Instead of a seal impression (<em>kunukku</em>), fingernail impression (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = [&hellip;]; <strong>B</strong> = &Scaron;a-Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;ū//[&hellip;]; Scribe = Nab&ucirc;-ahu-u&scaron;ab&scaron;i//Iddin-Nab&ucirc;<br /> &nbsp;"
