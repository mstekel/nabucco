paraphrase: "Copy of a dialogue document concerning the purchase of gold: <strong>A</strong>, priest (<em>&scaron;ang&ucirc;</em>) of Sippar, gave 1 talent of silver of the &Scaron;ama&scaron; Temple to <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> along with the order to acquire gold. <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>obtained 3 minas and 1 shekel of gold for that talent of silver. From that amount of gold <strong>A</strong> gave 27 minas and 53 shekels in silver to Esangila and assigned the remainder (<em>rēhu</em>) to the estate of &Scaron;ama&scaron; by adding it to the silver of &Scaron;ama&scaron;. In addition, he bought <strong>C</strong> and his family (<em>qinnu</em>) for 2 &frac12; minas of silver. The transaction is concluded in the presence of (<em>ina u&scaron;uzzi</em>) the governor (<em>bēl pihāti</em>) of Esangila (Marduk-&scaron;umu-ibni/Arad-Ea) and the <em>&scaron;atam bīt unāti</em>&nbsp; (Marduk-bān-zēri/Esangila). 9 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bulluṭu//Bunene-ibni, <em>&scaron;ang&ucirc;</em> (priest) of Sippar; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = &Scaron;ākin-&scaron;umi//Mādidu; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Marduk-erība//Kutimmu; <strong>C</strong> = Arad-Nanāya, Scribe = Zēria//Kidin-S&icirc;n<br /> &nbsp;"
