paraphrase: "Transfer of debt with adding security: <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s claim (<em>rā&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) to <strong>B<sub>1 </sub></strong>over 2 minas of silver has been transferred to <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, the brother of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>. Beginning with the current day, the debt bears an interest of 2 shekels of silver per month (20% p.a.). According to a fragmentarily preserved clause, the debt is secured by a pledge in terms of the house of <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>. 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Kunāya//Basia; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = &Scaron;ulāya//Ṭābia; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir//Ṭābia; Scribe = Bēl-u&scaron;allim//Irˀanni<br /> &nbsp;"
