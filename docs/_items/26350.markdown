paraphrase: "Purchase of a garden:<strong> A</strong> purchases a date garden (<em>kir&icirc;</em> <em>gi&scaron;immari</em>) from <strong>B<sub>1. </sub></strong>The purchase price (which is not preserved) corresponds to the claim (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) towards <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, the father of the seller, and, hence, is in fact not handed over; instead the garden serves as compensation. The transferred garden is located in the district (<em>erṣetu</em>) of the royal canal (<em>nār</em> <em>&scaron;arri</em>) in the meadowland (<em>ugāru</em>) of Uruk. Its upper side borders on (the property of) <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>, its lower side on (the property of) <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> and its lower front on <em>han&scaron;&ucirc;</em>-land. Its upper front, which measures 230 cubits (115 m), follows the royal canal (<em>nār &scaron;arri</em>). No cardinal directions are given in the record. 9 witnesses and the scribe. Fingernail impression (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller. The same type of procedure is recorded in BM118977.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/[Kiribtu]<em>; </em><strong>B<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Ahu-iddin-Marduk/Bēl-ibni; <strong>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Bēl-ibni/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-īpu&scaron;; <strong>B<sub>3 </sub></strong>= Ahhēa/Zabdānu; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>= Balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-nāṣir; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-lēˀi/Marduk; Scribe = Nadīnu//Ark&acirc;t-ilī<br /> &nbsp;"
