paraphrase: "Broken loan of silver: <strong>B</strong> owes <strong>A</strong> 1/3 shekels of silver. The debt is concluded along with the obligation of making (<em>labānu</em>) kiln-fired bricks (<em>agurru</em>) under the responsibility (<em>ina qātē</em>) of <strong>C</strong>. If this obligation is not fulfilled, the debt will bear a monthly interest of &frac12; shekel of silver (10% p.a.). 2 witnesses and the scribe, described here as writer of the promissory note (<em>&scaron;āṭir u&rsquo;ilti</em>).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = [&hellip;]//Inurta-[&hellip;]; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-kī-[&hellip;]; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēre&scaron;; Scribe = Nab&ucirc;-nāṣir//Ninurta-iqī&scaron;a<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;"
