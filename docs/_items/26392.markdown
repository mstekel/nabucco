The sold land is located in the city of &Scaron;aṭirtu and its upper front borders on the bank (<em>ki&scaron;adu</em>) of the Euphrates. It measures 290 square reeds (72.33 m<sup>2</sup>).&nbsp; The buyer <strong>A</strong> already has another share (<em>pūt zitti</em>) of the same land at his disposal. 7 witnesses and the scribe. Instead of a seal impression (<em>kunukku</em>), fingernail impression (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-zēru-ibni//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-iqī&scaron;a//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-iqī&scaron;a; Scribe = Marduk-u&scaron;allim//Egibi<br /> &nbsp;"
