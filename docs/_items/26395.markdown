paraphrase: "Purchase of a ruined house:<strong> A</strong> purchases from <strong>B</strong> a ruined house (<em>bītu abtu</em>) for 1 mina and 12 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), together with an additional payment (<em>atru</em>) of 2 shekels of silver. The sold house is located in the district (<em>erṣetu</em>) of the Canal of Urkayītu (<em>Harru-&scaron;a-Urkayītu</em>) inside of Uruk. Its upper side (in the north) borders on the narrow street (<em>sūqu qatnu</em>) and its lower side (in the south) on the house of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>. Its upper front (in the west) borders on the thoroughfare (<em>mūtaqu</em>) of the god and the king and its lower front (in the east) on the house of <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>. The transaction is concluded in the presence of (<em>ina u&scaron;uzzi</em>) the royal resident (<em>qīpu</em>) of Uruk and Eanna (&Scaron;ama&scaron;-ilūa). 13 witnesses (including Bēl-u&scaron;allim and Ṣillāya, two other sons of Bēl-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun, and &Scaron;umu-iddin, another son of &Scaron;a-Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;ū) and the scribe. Instead of a seal impression (<em>kunukku</em>), fingernail impression (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nadna-Marduk/Bēl-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun//Eṭēru; <strong>B</strong> = Ṣillāya/Nazia; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Iqī&scaron;āya/&Scaron;a-Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;ū; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Ahhēa/Bēl-rēmanni; Scribe = Marduk-&scaron;umu-uṣur/Zēr-Bābili<br /> &nbsp;"
