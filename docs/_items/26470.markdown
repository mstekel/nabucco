The sold plot of land is located in the district (<em>erṣetu</em>) of the New Canal (<em>nāru</em> <em>i&scaron;&scaron;etu</em>) in the meadowland (<em>ugāru</em>) of the district(?) of Uruk (<em>bīt Uruk</em>). Its upper side borders on (the property of) <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and its lower side on (the property of) <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>. Its lower front follows the I&scaron;&scaron;eti canal as far as (the property of) the neighbours. No cardinal directions for the sides are given in the record. The transaction is concluded in the presence of (<em>ina uzuzzi</em>) the governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>) of Uruk (Nab&ucirc;-kudurrī-uṣur). 6 witnesses and the scribe.
