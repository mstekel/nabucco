This prebend, however, has already been purchased by <strong>C</strong> from <strong>D</strong>, with <strong>E</strong>, (if restored correctly) brother of <strong>D</strong>, being the guarantor (<em>pūtu na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>). The dispute will be settled between <strong>B</strong> and <strong>E</strong> in Ayyār (II) of the following year in favour of <strong>A<sub>1 </sub></strong>and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>, while <strong>B</strong> will be charged with interest beginning with Simān (III).&nbsp; 2+ witnesses (and the scribe).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Marduk/Tabnēa; <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;allim/Bēl-iddin; <strong>B </strong>= Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Erība; <strong>C</strong> = Ahhēa/Erība; <strong>D</strong> = Ammēni-ilī/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;imanni; <strong>E</strong> = Bēl-ahhē-iddin; Scribe = [&hellip;]<br /> &nbsp;"
