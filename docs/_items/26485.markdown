paraphrase: "Purchase of wasteland in Dilbat:<strong> A</strong> purchases from <strong>B</strong> wasteland (<em>ki&scaron;ubb&ucirc;</em>) for 2 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>). The plot is located in the district (<em>erṣetu</em>) of the Gate of Ura&scaron; inside of Dilbat. Its upper side (in the east) borders on another property of the buyer and its lower side (in the west) on the property of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>. Its upper front (in the north) borders on the property of <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> and its lower front (in the south) on the property of <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong>, son of the buyer. The plot covers an area of 46 square cubits (12.25 m<sup>2</sup>) and is a passage (<em>mūṣ&ucirc;</em>), a narrow street (<em>sūqu</em> <em>qatnu</em>), with no exit&nbsp; (<em>lā</em> <em>aṣ&ucirc;</em>). 3 witnesses and the scribe. Instead of a seal impression (<em>kunukku</em>), fingernail impression (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller. The field (<em>eqlu</em>) belongs to (<em>pāni dagālu</em>) <strong>B</strong>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Upāqu/Nab&ucirc;-uṣallu; <strong>B </strong>= &Scaron;a-p&icirc;-Nab&ucirc;/Ibāya; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Bēl-uballiṭ/Nab&ucirc;-bāni; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Baratirˀu/Kiribtu; <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong> = Bēl-rēmanni/Upāqu, son of <strong>A</strong>; Scribe = Kudurru//Iddin-Papsukkal"
