paraphrase: "Loan of silver:<strong> B</strong> owes <strong>A</strong> 10 shekels of silver. Beginning with Addar (XI), the debt will bear an interest of 12 shekels per mina (20% p.a.). 4 witnesses and the scribe. An additional witness seems to be mentioned after the date formula.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = &Scaron;ulāya; <strong>B</strong> = Aqara; Scribe = Bēl-u&scaron;allim<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;"
