paraphrase: "Broken dispute concerning the redemption of a slave: After <strong>A</strong> redeemed (<em>paṭāru</em>) a slave (<em>amīlūtu</em>) from the hands of (<em>ina qātē</em>) <strong>B</strong>, <strong>B</strong> came and took away (<em>abāku</em>) his former slave from <strong>A</strong>. Consequently <strong>A</strong> took hold of <strong>B</strong> and reclaimed the full amount of money he had paid for the slave. The remainder of the main text is broken, while on the lower half of the reverse 3 witnesses and the scribe are preserved.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēre&scaron;; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-ibni; Scribe = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//[&hellip;]<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;"
