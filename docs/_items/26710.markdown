The sold garden is the (inheritance) share (<em>zittu</em>) the seller divided (<em>z&acirc;zu</em>) with his uncle <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>. It is located in the district (<em>erṣetu</em>) of the Ninurta Temple inside of Uruk. Its upper side borders on (the property of) the seller&rsquo;s grandfather <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> and its upper front on (the property of) the seller&rsquo;s uncle <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>. Its lower side borders on the Ninurta Temple and its lower front on the street (<em>sūqu</em>). Neither cardinal directions nor measures are given for the sides of the plot. 11 witnesses and the scribe.
