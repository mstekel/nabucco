paraphrase: "Purchase of a house in Uruk:<strong> A</strong> purchases a built house (<em>bītu</em> <em>ep&scaron;u</em>) for 10 minas of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>) from <strong>B</strong>. The sold house is located in the Eanna district (<em>erṣet Eanna</em>) inside of Uruk. Its upper side (in the west) borders on the house of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and its lower side (in the east) on the thoroughfare (<em>mūtaqu</em>) of the god and the king. Its upper front (in the north) borders on the house of <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> and its lower front (in the south) on a blind alley (<em>biriti lā aṣ&icirc;ti</em>). It measures 57 x 32 cubits (28.5 x 16 m). The transaction is concluded in the presence of (<em>ina uzuzzi</em>) the governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>) of Uruk (Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;ab&scaron;i) and the bishop (<em>&scaron;atammu</em>) of Eanna (Nab&ucirc;-iqī&scaron;a). 11 witnesses and the scribe. Fingernail impression (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller.
