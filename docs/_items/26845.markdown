The sold land is located in the district (<em>erṣetu</em>) of Babylon inside of Babylon. Its upper side (in the north) borders on he house of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and its lower side (in the south) on the narrow street (<em>sūqu</em> <em>qatnu</em>). Its upper front (in the east) borders on the house of <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> and its lower front (in the west) on the house of <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong>.
