paraphrase: "Purchase of land:<strong> A</strong> purchases from <strong>B</strong> 2 fields of <em>han&scaron;&ucirc;</em>-land and 1 field of <em>e&scaron;ertu</em>-land, which belong to <strong>C</strong>, for the price of 2 minas silver. So far <strong>A</strong> only paid 1 mina of silver; as soon as the outstanding amount of another 1 mina of silver is paid by <strong>A</strong>, a sealed record will be drawn up. The details about the fields are as follow: One <em>han&scaron;&ucirc;</em>-land is located in the irrigation district (<em>tamirtu</em>) of Mah&ucirc; and at the entrance of the irrigation district of Lītamu. It reaches from the bank (<em>ki&scaron;ādu</em>) of the Euphrates to the estate of <strong>D</strong>. The other <em>han&scaron;&ucirc;</em>-land is located on the Ki&scaron; Canal (Nāru Ki&scaron;). The land covers an area of in total 2,100 square cubits (525 m<sup>2</sup>). The transaction takes place in the presence of (<em>ina u&scaron;uzzi</em>) of 6 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-lēˀi-kulatti//Saggilāya, <em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi &scaron;a Bābili</em> (governor of Babylon); <strong>B </strong>= Bēl-u&scaron;allim//Ir&rsquo;anni; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-ēpu&scaron;//As&ucirc;; <strong>D</strong> = Kaṣṣir; Scribe = Ṭāb-a&scaron;ābi-Marduk//Ir&rsquo;anni<br /> &nbsp;"
