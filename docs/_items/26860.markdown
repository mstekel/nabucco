paraphrase: "Loan of silver:<strong> B</strong> owes <strong>A</strong> 16 shekels of silver. In case <strong>B</strong> brings along and gives <strong>C</strong> (<em>abāku</em>-<em>nadānu</em>) to <strong>A</strong> at the end of the current month, no interest will be charged and <strong>B</strong> will be freed from his debts. If he fails to do so, the debt amount will increase by 1 &frac14; shekels of silver. 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Zēru-ukīn//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;allim/Rēmūtu; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-gāmil; Scribe = Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu<br /> &nbsp;"
