They mutually guarantee (<em>pūtu na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) for the repayment of the debt. The one who is available, will pay the debt sum in full (<em>&scaron;alāmu</em> D). 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = &Scaron;ullum//Enlilia; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Aplāya//Ninurta-nāṣir; Scribe = Ninurta-zākir-&scaron;umi//Ahu-lūmur; (24th of Ulūl (VI), S&icirc;n-&scaron;arru-i&scaron;kun 2)<br /> &nbsp;<br /> In case (b) <strong>B</strong> owes <strong>A</strong> 1 mina of silver to be paid back on the first of Ta&scaron;rīt (VII).

Further details are broken. 4 witnesses and the scribe. In additional clause seems to say that <strong>B</strong> has to pay interest (<em>ṣibtu</em>) for two years.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>B</strong> = [&hellip;]//Dummuqu; Scribe = [&hellip;]//Kalum; (A&scaron;&scaron;ur-etel-ilāni 3)<br /> &nbsp;<br /> In case (d) <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> owe <strong>A</strong> [x] amounts of silver.
