paraphrase: "Settlement of a dispute concerning land: <strong>A</strong> starts a lawsuit (<em>dīnu</em> <em>ger&ucirc;</em>) against <strong>B</strong> concerning the dimensions of the field of Bīt-Ibuni before <strong>C</strong>. According to <strong>A</strong> this field does not reach from Dukkuindu to the lowland (<em>u&scaron;allu</em>) of the Gubbatu Canal. After it has been decided that both have to go to the ordeal (<em>hur&scaron;ānu</em>), <strong>B</strong> brings and hands over (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>-<em>nadānu</em>) &frac12; mina and 3 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>. <strong>A</strong> voluntarily (<em>ina hūd libbi&scaron;u</em>) gives a sealed tablet to <strong>B</strong> in which he promises not to return to this issue and litigate against him again. 5 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = &Scaron;a-Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;&ucirc;; <strong>B</strong> = Munnabittu; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-lē&rsquo;i, governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>) of Babylon; Scribe = Balāssu//Bēl-ēṭir<br /> &nbsp;"
