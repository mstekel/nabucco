paraphrase: "Purchase of land in Babylon:<strong> A</strong> (name lost) purchases 588 square cubits (147 m<sup>2</sup>) of wasteland (<em>eqlu ki&scaron;ubb&ucirc;</em>) for [x] amounts of silver from <strong>B</strong> (name lost). The sold land is located in the district (<em>erṣetu</em>) of the New Town inside of Babylon. Its upper side (in the south) borders on a street (<em>sūqu</em>) and its lower side (in the north) on the house of <strong>C</strong> (name lost). The bordering areas of the upper front (in the west) and the lower front (in the east) are broken. The side lengths of the sold land are said to be &ldquo;broken&rdquo; (<em>hep&ucirc;</em>). [x] witnesses and the scribe (broken).<br /> &nbsp;"
