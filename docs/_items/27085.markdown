paraphrase: "Purchase of a garden:<strong> A</strong> purchases a half share (<em>ahu</em>) of a date garden (<em>kir&icirc;</em> <em>gi&scaron;immari</em>) for 5 minas of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), together with an additional payment (<em>atru</em>) of 10 shekels of silver, from <strong>B</strong>. The sold garden is located in the district (<em>erṣetu</em>) of the Ninurta Temple inside of Uruk and actually borders on the Ninurta Temple. No other information about location and seize of the garden is given in the record. The other half of the said garden is already owned by the buyer (BM118972). The transaction is concluded in the presence of (<em>ina uzuzzi</em>) the governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>) of Uruk (Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;ab&scaron;i) and the bishop (<em>&scaron;atammu</em>) of Eanna (Nab&ucirc;-iqī&scaron;a). 17 witnesses and the scribe. Fingernail impression (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Kiribtu; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-ahhē-iddin/Kudurru; Scribe = Balāṭu/Bēl-lēˀi<br /> &nbsp;"
