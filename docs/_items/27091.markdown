paraphrase: "Purchase of wasteland:<strong> A</strong> purchases wasteland (<em>ki&scaron;ubb&ucirc;</em>) for 50 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), together with an additional payment (<em>atru</em>) of 1 shekel of silver, from <strong>B</strong>. The sold land is located in the district of the Great Gate (<em>erṣet bābi rab&icirc;</em>) inside of Uruk. Its upper side (in the south) borders on the house of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and its upper front (in the east) on the house(s) of <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong>. Its lower side (in the north) and its lower front (in the west) border on the houses of <strong>C<sub>4 </sub></strong>. The lower front also borders a narrow street (<em>sūqu qatnu</em>). The plot covers an area of 33 x 43 cubits (16.5 x 21.5 m). 5 witnesses (including Zabidāya, father of the scribe, and Iddin-Nab&ucirc; both from the S&icirc;n-leqe-unninnī family) and the scribe. The transaction is concluded in the presence of (<em>ina u&scaron;uzzi</em>) the governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>) of Uruk (Naˀid-Marduk). Instead of a seal impression (<em>kunukku</em>), fingernail impression (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;allim/Bēl-iddin; <strong>B</strong> = Rēmūtu/Barbaru; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Balāssu/Marduk-ēṭir; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Balāṭu/ˀAdu; <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong> = Iqi&scaron;āya/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-&scaron;ullim; <strong>C<sub>4</sub></strong> = Ahu-at&acirc;/Nūrea; Scribe = Apkallu/Zabidāya//S&icirc;n-leqe-unninnī<br /> &nbsp;"
