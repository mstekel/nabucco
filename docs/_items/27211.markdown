paraphrase: "Purchase of a garden: A purchases a date garden (kir&icirc; gi&scaron;immari) for 2 5/6 minas of silver in pieces (&scaron;ibirtu) from B. The sold garden is located inside of Uruk. Its lower front (in the south) borders on the moat (harīṣu) of the gate (abullu) of the goddess Irnin(n)a and its lower side (in the west) on the thoroughfare (mūtaqu) of the god and the king. Its upper side (in the east) borders on (the property of) C. The bordering area of the upper front (in the north) is not specified. The upper front and the lower front each measure 100 cubits (50 m). The upper side is said to be as long as the one of (the property of) the neighbour C. The length of the lower side is not specified. The transaction is concluded in the presence of (ina uzuzzi) the governor (&scaron;ākin ṭēmi) of Uruk (Ahhē&scaron;āya) and the bishop (&scaron;atammu) of Eanna (Nab&ucirc;-nāṣir). 15 witnesses (including the a&scaron;lāku [tanner] Nab&ucirc;-useppi) and the scribe, also defined as writer of the tablet (&scaron;āṭir ṭuppi). Fingernail impression (ṣupru) of the seller. &nbsp;<br /> <br /> A = L&acirc;b&acirc;&scaron;i/Nab&ucirc;-lēˀi; B = Bēl&scaron;unu/Ahhē&scaron;āya; C = Bēl-ēṭir; Scribe = Nab&ucirc;-lēˀi//Iddin-Papsukkal"
