The sold house is located in the Eanna district (<em>erṣet Eanna</em>) inside of Uruk. Its upper side (in the north), its lower side (in the south) and its lower front (in the east) border on the houses of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong>. Its upper front (in the west) borders on a house already owned by the buyer. No side lengths are given in the record. 16 witnesses and the scribe.
