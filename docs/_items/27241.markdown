paraphrase: "Purchase of wasteland:<strong> A</strong> purchases from <strong>B</strong> wasteland (<em>eqlu </em><em>ki&scaron;ubb&ucirc;</em>), for [x] minas and 15 shekels of silver, including silver for [x] kor of barley for the seller&rsquo;s fingernail impression. The plot is located in the district (<em>erṣetu</em>) of the Gate of LUGAL.GU(D).SI.S&Aacute; inside of GIR.GI.LUM.KI (= Nippur?). Its upper side (in the north) borders on a property of the buyer <strong>A</strong> and on a house of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and its lower side (in the south) on the property of <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>. Its upper front (in the east) borders on the property of <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong> and its lower front (in the west) on another property of the buyer. Its upper side measures 34 cubits (17 m), its lower side 30 cubits (15 m), its upper front 32 cubits (16 m) and its lower front 21(?) cubits (10.5 m). 11+ witnesses (including <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong>) and the scribe, also defined as sealer of the tablet (<em>kānik ṭuppi</em>).
