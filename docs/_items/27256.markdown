First, <strong>A</strong> purchases 4 square kor (54,000 m<sup>2</sup>) arable land (<em>zēru</em>), a garden with date palms bearing fruit (<em>kir&icirc; gi&scaron;immari</em> <em>zaqpi</em> <em>iṣṣi</em> <em>bilti</em>), for 19 minas of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), together with an additional payment (<em>atru</em>) of &frac12; mina of silver. The sold garden is located in the meadowland (<em>ugāru</em>) of the Zababa Gate in the province (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon. Its upper side (in the north) borders on the Imgur-Illil Wall and on (the property of) <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and its lower side (in the south) on the bank (<em>ki&scaron;ādu</em>) of the Bānītu Canal (<em>Nāru-&scaron;a-Bānītu</em>) as well as (the property or properties of) <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong>. Its upper front (in the west) borders on (the property of) <strong>C<sub>4</sub></strong> and its lower front (in the east) on the bank of the Bānītu Canal. Second, <strong>A</strong> purchases 30 square kor (405,000 m<sup>2</sup>) of arable land, a field in the countryside planted with trees (<em>eqlu ṣēru p&icirc; &scaron;ulpi</em>) for 7 &frac12; minas of silver.
