paraphrase: "Purchase of field: <strong>A</strong> purchases a half share of a field (<em>eqlu</em>) for 2 &frac12; minas of silver from <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and his mother <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong>. The plot of land comprises a date garden (<em>kir&icirc;</em> <em>gi&scaron;immari</em>) and wasteland (<em>ki&scaron;ubb&ucirc;</em>) and is located in the district (<em>erṣetu</em>) of the Ninurta Temple inside of Uruk. Its upper side borders on the city wall (<em>dūr āli</em>), while its lower side, upper front and lower front border on (the properties of) <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong>. The upper front also borders on a street (<em>sūqu</em>). No cardinal directions are given in the record. Its upper side measures 350 cubits (175 m), its lower side and upper front 300 cubits (150 m) and its lower front 200 cubits (100 m). The plot presumably is the first half of the land bought by <strong>A</strong> from <strong>B<sub>1</sub> </strong>and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> one year later (BM119872). The transaction is concluded in the presence (<em>ina u&scaron;uzzi</em>) of the governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>) of Uruk (Ahhē&scaron;āya) and the bishop (<em>&scaron;atammu</em>) of Eanna (Balāṭu). 14 witnesses and the scribe. Fingernail impressions (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the sellers.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Kiribtu; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>= Bēl-ahhē-iddin/Kudurru; <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Nasqat; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Zākiru, <em>a&scaron;kāpu</em> (leatherworker); <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Eanna-ibni, <em>pahāru</em> (potter); <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Zibāya/Ēre&scaron;u; Scribe = Bēl-īpu&scaron;//&Scaron;ama&scaron;-bāri<br /> &nbsp;"
