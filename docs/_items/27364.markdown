paraphrase: "Purchase of a field:<strong> A</strong> purchases from <strong>B</strong> a field (<em>eqlu</em>) for 1/3 mina and [x] shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), including [x] shekel of silver for the seller&rsquo;s fingernail impression. The description of the bordering areas is not preserved. The plot of land measures 37 x 25 cubits (18.5 x 12.5 m). 11+ witnesses and the scribe, also defined as writer of the tablet (<em>&scaron;āṭir ṭuppi</em>). Instead of a seal impression (<em>kunukku</em>), fingernail impression (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Perˀu/&Scaron;u[&hellip;]; <strong>B </strong>= &Scaron;ama&scaron;-erība//Eppē&scaron;-ilī; Scribe = Abi-maqar//Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;allim<br /> &nbsp;"
