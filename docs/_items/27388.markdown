paraphrase: "Dialogue document concerning the purchase of a prebend: <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> approach <strong>A</strong> with a request to buy the prebend of the temple scribe (<em>ṭup&scaron;ar bītūti</em>) of (literally) their father, and their entire assets (<em>nikkassu &scaron;a āli u ṣēri</em>), for 50 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>). <strong>A</strong> grants the request and weighs out and pays (<em>h&acirc;ṭu-nadānu</em>) the money in order to receive a sealed tablet (<em>kunukku</em>) over the ownership of the prebend of the temple scribe. The amount of 50 shekels of silver is the outstanding amount of 2 minas and 40 shekels of silver less 1 mina 50 shekels of silver which belong to (<em>ana muhhi p&icirc;</em>) <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>, (literally) brothers of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>. The transaction is concluded in the presence of (<em>ina u&scaron;uzzi</em>) the governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>) of Ur (S&icirc;n-tabni-uṣur). 5 witnesses (including Nab&ucirc;-ahu-uṣur/Bēl-iqī&scaron;a, <em>&scaron;a-qurbūti</em> and S&icirc;n-&scaron;arru-uṣur, scout [<em>dayālu</em>]) and the scribe. Instead of a seal impression (<em>kunukku</em>), fingernail impression (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the two sellers. In case <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> comes to Ur, <strong>A</strong> will voluntarily (<em>in hūd libbi</em>) give him the house located next to <strong>D</strong> as well as the prebend (<em>isqu</em>) before the Lady of Ur. In case <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> does not come to Ur, this property will remain in the possession of <strong>A</strong>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Ningal-u&scaron;ēzib/Palil-iddin; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Balāssu/S&icirc;n-bār-ilāni/Hallur&scaron;u; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Ahhū-ṭābū/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-iddin/Nab&ucirc;-nāṣir; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Aplāya; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-mudammiq-ilī; <strong>D</strong> = S&icirc;n-iddin/S&icirc;n-ahu-&scaron;ub&scaron;i; Scribe = S&icirc;n-&scaron;ar-ilāni/Bēl-īpu&scaron;<br /> <br /> *Note that the family relationships &ldquo;father&rdquo; and &ldquo;brother&rdquo;, as given in the text, do not (necessarily) correspond to the actual relations. <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> apparently had not the same father and it remains unclear if and how <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> could have (partly) been brothers of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;"
