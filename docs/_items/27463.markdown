paraphrase: "Purchase of a house in Uruk:<strong> A</strong> purchases a ruined house (<em>bītu abtu</em>) for 50 shekels of silver, together with an additional payment (<em>atru</em>) of one woolen garment (T&Uacute;G.KUR.RA), from <strong>B</strong>. The sold house is located in the Eanna district (<em>erṣet Eanna</em>) inside Uruk. Its upper side (in the north) and its upper front (in the west) border on houses already owned by the buyer. Its lower front (in the east) borders on the house of <strong>C</strong> and its lower side (in the south) borders on a blind alley (<em>biriti lā aṣ&icirc;ti</em>). No side lengths are given in the record. The transaction is concluded in the presence of (<em>ina uzuzzi</em>) the governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>) of Uruk (Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;ab&scaron;i) and the bishop (<em>&scaron;atammu</em>) of Eanna (Nab&ucirc;-iqī&scaron;a). 10 witnesses and the scribe. Fingernail impression (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Kiribtu; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēre&scaron;/Ha&scaron;dia; <strong>C</strong> = Ahhē&scaron;āya/Nanāya-uṣalli; Scribe = Balāṭu/Bēl-lēˀi<br /> &nbsp;"
