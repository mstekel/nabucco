paraphrase: "Cancellation of a purchase of a prebend: According to the annihilated tablet (<em>ṭuppi &scaron;iprēti</em>), <strong>A</strong> has purchased the prebend of the temple-enterer (<em>ērib</em> <em>bītūti</em>) in the Eimbianu, the Ura&scaron; Temple, before Bēlet-ekalli for 2 minas and 2 shekels of silver from <strong>B</strong>. However, <strong>C</strong> raises claim on the sold property since it is family estate. The purchase is cancelled and the prebend is property of <strong>C</strong>. 11(+) witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Kudurru/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-bulliṭ//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Dilbat; <strong>B </strong>= Iqī&scaron;a-Marduk/Nab&ucirc;-zēru-lī&scaron;ir//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Marduk-&scaron;āpik-zēri/Erība-Marduk//Egibi; Scribe = Lūṣi-ana-nūr-Marduk/Bēl-ipu&scaron;/Egibi<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;"
