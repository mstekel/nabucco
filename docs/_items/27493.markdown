paraphrase: "Purchase of a date garden:<strong> A</strong> purchases from <strong>B</strong> a planted and cultivated (<em>zaqpu u p&icirc; &scaron;ulpi</em>) date garden (<em>kir&icirc;</em> <em>gi&scaron;immari</em>) for [x] amounts of silver. The plot of land is located in the area of Bīt-Zabīni in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Uruk. Its upper side (in the east) and its upper front (in the north) border on (the properties of) <strong>C</strong>, presumably the father of the buyer. Its lower side (in the west) borders on the bank (<em>ki&scaron;ādu</em>) of the Harru-&scaron;a-nēri canal. The bordering area of the lower front (in the south) is not specified. No dimensions are given. In connection with the upper side and the lower side it is stated that they have to be measured out (<em>madādu</em>). The remainder of the main text body and the beginning of the witness list are broken. 6+ witnesses and the scribe. Fingernail impression (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-aplu-uṣur/Ina-tē&scaron;&icirc;-ēṭir; <strong>B </strong>= Bēl&scaron;unu/Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;allim; <strong>C</strong> = Ina-tē&scaron;&icirc;-ēṭir/Rēmūtu; Scribe = Bēl-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun/Bēl-ahhē-erība"
