The sold house is located in the district (<em>erṣetu</em>) of the Market Gate (<em>bāb mahīri</em>) inside of Uruk. Its upper and lower side (in the north and south) as well as upper front (in the west) border on the houses of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong>. Its lower front (in the east) borders on the thoroughfare (<em>mūtaqu</em>) of the god and the king. It measures 55 x 30 cubits (27.5 x 15 m). The seller has taken an oath (<em>nī&scaron;u zakāru</em>) by the god Marduk well as his divine spouse Zarpanītu and by the king.
