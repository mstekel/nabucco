paraphrase: "Purchase of land and an empty house:<strong> A</strong> purchases three parcels of land for 34(+?) minas of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>) from <strong>B</strong>. The three parcels of land include the half share (<em>ahu</em>) of an orchard (<em>kir&ucirc;</em>), an empty house plot (<em>bītu</em> <em>ki&scaron;ubb&ucirc;</em>) and a piece of grain-cultivated land (<em>zēru p&icirc; &scaron;ulpi</em>). The orchard is located in the meadowland (<em>ugāru</em>) of Uruk. Its upper side, its lower side and its upper front borders on the houses of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong>. Its lower front follows the royal canal (<em>nār &scaron;arri</em>). No cardinal directions for the sides of the orchard are given. The empty house plot is located in the district (<em>erṣetu</em>) of the Market Gate (<em>bāb mahīri</em>) inside Uruk. Its upper side (in the west) borders on the thoroughfare (<em>mūtaqu</em>) of the god and the king and its lower side (in the east) on the house of <strong>C<sub>4</sub></strong>. Its upper front (in the north) borders on the house(s) of <strong>C<sub>5</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>6</sub></strong> and its lower front (in the south) on the narrow street (<em>sūqu</em> <em>qatnu</em>). The plot of cultivated land is located in the meadowland of the Angillu irrigation district (<em>tamirtu</em>) and along the upper (<em>el&ucirc;</em>) royal canal (<em>nār &scaron;arri</em>) in the meadowland of Uruk. Neither cardinal directions for the sides nor any other information about the bordering areas are given. No side lengths are given for any of the three plots. All this is the (inheritance) share (<em>zittu</em>) which <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, the father of the seller, received from <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong>, the grandfather of the seller. 15 witnesses (including the priest [<em>&scaron;ang&ucirc;</em>] of Larsa) and the scribe. Fingernail impressions (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Kiribtu/S&icirc;n-nāṣir; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-nādin-&scaron;umi/&Scaron;ulāya/Ṭābia; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = &Scaron;ulāya/Ahhēa/Ṭābia; <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> = Ahhēa/Aplāya/Ṭābia; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Kudurru//Nab&ucirc;-naˀid; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nādinu//Ēre&scaron;u; <strong>C<sub>3</sub> </strong>= Pirˀu//Bēl-useppi; <strong>C<sub>4</sub></strong> = Ilūˀa/&Scaron;ullumu; <strong>C<sub>5</sub></strong> = [&hellip;]/&Scaron;ullumu; <strong>C<sub>6</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-erība//&Scaron;āpiku; Scribe = Rēmūt-Bāba//Ark&acirc;t-ilī"
