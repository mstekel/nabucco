paraphrase: "Dialogue document about a settlement of a dispute concerning small livestock: <strong>A</strong> files a suit against <strong>B</strong> saying that he did not receive a share of the revenue of the sale of 27 small livestock animals. The assembly of the Babylonians and Dilbateans sent them to the ordeal of the 14th of Addar (XII). <strong>A</strong> will give 1 mina of silver and <strong>B</strong> 2 minas of silver. They will go to the ordeal on the 4th of Abu (V). 8 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-ēṭir; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-ēre&scaron;; Scribe = Nab&ucirc;-ahu-iddin//Bāˀiru<br /> &nbsp;"
