paraphrase: "Broken receipt of silver payments: <strong>A</strong>, by order of (<em>ina qībi</em>) <strong>C</strong>, receives from <strong>B</strong> a broken amount of what seems to be silver, paid for the rent of a certain month (the name of which is broken off) of Darius 11<sup>th</sup> year. This includes (<em>adi</em>) the [previous claim] for 5 minas of silver that was still pending. Each party has taken a copy (<em>&scaron;aṭāru</em>). 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-uballiṭ/Murānu; <strong>B</strong> = Dādia/[&hellip;]-ahhē-iddin; <strong>C</strong> = Marduk-rēmanni/Bēl-uballiṭ//Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;; Scribe = [&hellip;]/Ardia//[&hellip;]<br /> &nbsp;"
