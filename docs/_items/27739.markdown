paraphrase: "Receipt of silver: <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> receives from <strong>B</strong> 2 minas and 29 shekels of silver, share (<em>zittu</em>) of <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>, and 1 mina of silver out of 17 minas and 22 shekels (either this should be rather 52 shekels of silver or the subtotals are incorrect) which are due from <strong>B</strong> because he illegally seized property (<em>ṣibtētu</em>) of <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>. The payment of silver replaces physical punishment: 16 5/6 minas of silver instead (<em>kūm</em>) of cutting off (<em>batāqu</em>) <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s hand (<em>rittu</em>) and 1 mina and 2 shekels of silver instead of 21 beatings (<em>mihṣu</em>). <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> will give proof that he fully received (<em>mahāru eṭēru</em>) the money and guarantees (<em>pūtu na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) that his brother <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> won&rsquo;t litigate (<em>dabābu</em>). This is apart from (<em>elat</em>) the previous document (<em>&scaron;aṭāru</em>) concerning 3(+) minas and [x] shekels of silver, share of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>, paid by <strong>B</strong>. It is also apart from the 8 shekels of silver paid in the previous tablet. 26 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nusku-īnāya, brother of <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>;&nbsp; <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = Ba-Ilteri-ahatta/Nusku-ayalu, brother of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-rēmanni/Bēl-uballiṭ//Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;; Scribe = Bēl-ahhē-iddin/Nab&ucirc;-tabtani-uṣur//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;"
