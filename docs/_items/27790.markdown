paraphrase: "Partly broken dialogue document concerning an adoption of a son: <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>B</strong> approaches <strong>A</strong>, her son-in-law, and asks him to adopt (<em>ana mārūti nadānu</em>) his eldest son <strong>C</strong>, her grandson. <strong>A</strong> grants the request (<em>&scaron;em&ucirc;</em>) and entrusts <strong>C</strong>. <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>B</strong> will voluntarily (<em>ina hūd libbi&scaron;u</em>) give the adoptee 0;0.1 kor (6 l) of bread and 0;0.1 kor (6 l) of first quality (<em>rē&scaron;tu</em>) beer, income of the prebend of the temple-enterer (<em>isiq ērib bītūti</em>) in Egukug(a), the Ziqqurrat of Sippar, which [PN] had given to her in a sealed tablet as compensation for 10 minas of silver. Large gap. The adoptee will provide his adoptive mother with food (<em>ipru</em>), ointment (<em>pi&scaron;&scaron;atu</em>) and clothing (<em>lubu&scaron;tu</em>). He will grow up at her place and enjoy the usufruct of her assets (<em>nikkassu</em>) as long as she lives and receive her assets when she dies (<em>ana &scaron;īmti alāku</em>). She will not adopt any other son. Broken passage and gap. 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-uballiṭ/Iqī&scaron;a//Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;; <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Zazītu/Nab&ucirc;-zēru-lī&scaron;ir//Bā&rsquo;iru; <strong>C</strong> = Marduk-rēmanni/Bēl-uballiṭ//Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;; Scribe = &Scaron;ama&scaron;-nāṣir/Mu&scaron;eb&scaron;i-Marduk//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;<br /> &nbsp;"
