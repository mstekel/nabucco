paraphrase: "Settlement of a dispute concerning a prebend: After <strong>B</strong> gave to <strong>A </strong>the prebend of the oil presser (<em>isiq ṣāhitūti</em>) before Bēl in Esagil for an amount of silver, he states that the prebend is his and that <strong>A</strong> is not the his nephew. The <em>bishop</em> (<em>&scaron;atammu</em>) of Esagil (GN-ahu-iddin) checked the copy (<em>&scaron;aṭāru</em>) in question and [gave back to <strong>A</strong>?]. Another broken sentence concerning the charging (<em>man&ucirc;</em>) of the credit (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>). Passage broken. 6 witnesses (all <em>ērib bīti</em> of Marduk) and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-uballiṭ, (deceased?) father of Marduk-remanni; <strong>B</strong> = Dādia/Kabtia//Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;; Scribe = [&Scaron;a-GN]-&scaron;ū//&Scaron;arru-araz&ucirc;<br /> &nbsp;"
