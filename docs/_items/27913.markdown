paraphrase: "Lease of a house: <strong>A</strong> rents out to <strong>B</strong> a house for 7 shekels of silver with stamp-mark (<em>kaspu &scaron;a ginne</em>) rent (<em>idū</em>) per year, beginning with the 1<sup>st</sup> of Ulūl (VI). Most of the information about the exact location of the rented house is lost, but it is said to adjoin a <em>bīt kuruppi</em>-warehouse and the house of <strong>C</strong>. The lessee shall pay one half share of the rent (<em>ahi kaspi</em>) at the beginning of the year and the remainder (<em>rēhtu</em>) in the middle of the year. The lessor already received the full rent for the first year and the lessee will make an additional gift (<em>nūptu</em>) in D&ucirc;zu (IV) and Kislīm (IX). Each party has taken a copy. 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-rēmanni/Bēl-uballiṭ//Ṣāhit-sattukki; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-zēri/&Scaron;addinnu //Itinnu; <strong>C</strong> = [&hellip;]/Nergal-&scaron;ēzib; Scribe = Rēmūt-Bēl/Bēl-uballiṭ<br /> &nbsp;"
