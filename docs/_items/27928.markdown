paraphrase: "Lease of a house: <strong>A</strong> rents out to <strong>B</strong> a house for [x] amounts of white silver (<em>kaspu peṣ&ucirc;</em>) by 1/8 alloy (<em>bitqu</em>) per shekel. The location of the said house is lost. The tenant shall pay one half share of the rent (<em>ahi kaspi</em>) at the beginning of the year and the remainder (<em>rēhtu</em>) in the middle of the year. He will renew the roof (<em>ūru &scaron;an&ucirc;</em>) and repair (<em>batqu ṣabātu</em>) the walls (<em>asurr&ucirc;</em><em>)</em>. Each party has taken a copy. 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-bullissu/Marudk-rēmanni//Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;; <strong>B</strong> = Niqūdu/Rēmutu; Scribe = Bēl-bullissu/Nab&ucirc;-ittannu"
