paraphrase: "Oath concerning the payment of silver: <strong>B</strong> swears (<em>tam&ucirc;</em>) to <strong>C</strong> by Bēl, Nab&ucirc; and the king of Babylon that he will pay (<em>eṭēru</em>) the silver according to the promissory note (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) of <strong>A</strong> before the 1<sup>st</sup> of Ta&scaron;rīt (VII). If he fails to pay, <strong>D</strong>, whom the creditor has taken as a pledge, will become property of the creditor as full compensation of the claimed silver. 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Lūṣi-ana-nūri/&Scaron;umu-ukīn//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-I&scaron;tar; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-iddin/Iddin-Nab&ucirc;//S&icirc;n-karābī; <strong>C</strong> = Marduk-rēmanni/Bēl-uballiṭ//Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;; Scribe = Marduk-&scaron;umu-uṣur/Nab&ucirc;-[x]//S&icirc;n-imittu<br /> &nbsp;"
