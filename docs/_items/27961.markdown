The lessee shall pay one half share of the rent (<em>ahi kaspi</em>) at the beginning of the year and the remainder (<em>rēhtu</em>) in the middle of the year. He will repair (<em>batqu ṣabātu</em>) the walls (<em>asurr&ucirc;</em>) and renew the roof (<em>ūru &scaron;an&ucirc;</em>). On the day of Enlil and the <em>kīnayātu</em>-offerings he will make an additional payment (<em>nūptu</em>). 5 witnesses and the scribe. Each party has taken a copy.
