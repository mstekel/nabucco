paraphrase: "Clearance of debts: According to the wording of the tablet, an account is drawn up (<em>nikkassu epē&scaron;u</em>) concerning 5 5/6 minas of silver with stamp-mark (<em>kaspu &scaron;a ginni</em>) by 1/8 alloy (<em>bitqu</em>) per shekel, without interest (<em>qaqqadu</em>), belonging to <strong>A</strong>: <strong>B</strong>, on behalf of (<em>ana muhhi</em>) the debtor <strong>C</strong>, uncle of <strong>A</strong>, paid (<em>eṭēru</em>) 7 1/3 minas and 2 shekels of silver, including interest (<em>hubullu</em>), to the creditor (<em>rā&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) <strong>A</strong>. Thereafter <strong>A</strong> bought the slave woman (<em>qallatu</em>) <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>D</strong> belonging to <strong>B</strong>. <strong>B</strong> brought the promissory note (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) from <strong>A</strong> and handed it over (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>-<em>nadānu</em>) to the debtor <strong>C</strong>. Therewith <strong>C</strong> has been paid 8 minas of silver, price (<em>&scaron;īmu</em>) for his female slave (<em>amīltu</em>), by <strong>B</strong>. In fact, <strong>B</strong> pays to <strong>C</strong> 8 minas for <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>D</strong> and sells her for 7 1/3 minas to <strong>A</strong>. This legal fiction seems to have been established on the background of a dowry payment (BM74548). 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-rēmanni/Bēl-uballiṭ//Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;; <strong>B</strong> = Lūṣi-ana-nūri/&Scaron;umu-ukīn//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-I&scaron;tar-Bābili; <strong>C</strong> = Nergal-&scaron;umu-iddin/Iqī&scaron;a// Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;; <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>D</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Nanāya-&scaron;umahūa; Scribe = Bēl-rēmanni/Mu&scaron;eb&scaron;i-Marduk//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;<br /> <br /> &nbsp;"
