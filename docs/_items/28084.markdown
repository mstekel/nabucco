The debt will bear a monthly interest of 1 shekel of silver per mina (20% p.a.). The debtor&rsquo;s field is placed as a pledge until (<em>adi</em>) <strong>A</strong> has obtained in full (<em>&scaron;alāmu</em>) the credited sum of silver which he took up as guarantor (<em>pūtu na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) for <strong>B</strong> on account of (<em>ina qātē</em>) <strong>D</strong>. The said field is located in Du(r)bissu and borders (the properties of) the judge (<em>dayyānu</em>) <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong> and the banks (<em>ki&scaron;ādu</em>) of the Euphrates as well as the Du(r)bissu Canal. 6 witnesses and the scribe.
