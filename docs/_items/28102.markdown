They will equally (<em>ahāta</em>) share the profit (<em>utru</em>). Of the fertile ewes from among 100 female small livestock &ndash; 60 fertile (<em>ālittu</em>) ewes, 30 female lambs (<em>parratu</em>) and 10 fertile she-goats &ndash; <strong>B</strong> will give the male and female lambs (<em>parru u</em> <em>parratu</em>) during 2 years. Per 100 ewes he shall give 2 talents and 10 minas of wool, including (<em>adi</em>) the shorn wool (<em>gizzatu</em>) of the female lambs. The present contract is apart from (<em>elat</em>) the 3-year-old donkey of <strong>A</strong>. <strong>B</strong> guarantees (<em>pūtu na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) for taking care (<em>suddudu</em>) and the guard (<em>maṣṣartu</em>) of the donkeys. Per goat he shall give 5/6 mina of hair (<em>&scaron;ārtu</em>). 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-uballiṭ/Iqī&scaron;a//Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;; <strong>B</strong> = S&icirc;n-ahu-iddin/&Scaron;a-Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;ū; Scribe = Itti-&Scaron;ama&scaron;-balāṭu/Bēl-kāṣir//S&icirc;n-dā&rsquo;in<br /> &nbsp;"
