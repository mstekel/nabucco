paraphrase: "Receipt of rent: <strong>A</strong> receives from <strong>B</strong> 1 mina and 18 shekels of white cut silver without stamp-mark (<em>kaspu peṣ&ucirc; nuhhutu &scaron;a lā ginne</em>) by 1/8 alloy (<em>bitqu</em>) per shekel. It is the payment for the rent (<em>idū</em>) of the house and for the <em>&scaron;ugarr&ucirc;</em> (= date palm product) that was still needed to be paid for the period from Arahsamna (VIII) of Darius 25<sup>th</sup> year until the end of Ṭebēt (X) of the present year, i.e. for the past 3 years and 3 months. After <strong>A</strong> will have brought the document (<em>&scaron;aṭāru</em>) in &Scaron;abāṭ (XI) of the present year, <strong>B</strong> will entrust (<em>paqādu</em>) to <strong>A</strong> the <em>bīt kuruppi</em>-warehouse. After the said period, <strong>B</strong> has to pay 2 shekels of white silver per month to <strong>A</strong>. 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-rēmanni/Bēl-uballiṭ//Ṣāhit-sattukki; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-zēri/Bunene-ibni; Scribe = Marduk-ēre&scaron;/Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-apli<br /> &nbsp;"
