paraphrase: "Payment of the pending compensation of dowry: On the first day of D&ucirc;zu (IV) <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> and his brothers will pay to <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> (their stepmother) 3 minas of silver. This is instead of the dowry (<em>nudunn&ucirc;</em>) which her husband <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, father of the brothers, promised to give her in addition to (<em>elat</em>) the slave woman <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>C </strong>who is also part of the dowry. The transaction is concluded in the presence of (<em>ina mahar</em>) the judges (<em>dayyānu</em>) Bēl-iddin, Nargiya and Munahhi&scaron;-Marduk each of whom also put a sealing (<em>kunukku</em>) on the tablet. Except for the scribe no other witnesses are mentioned.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Bu&rsquo;ītu/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-mukīn-apli; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Bēl-uballiṭ/Iqī&scaron;a//Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Marduk-rēmanni/Bēl-uballiṭ//Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Nanāya-bēlu-uṣrī; Scribe = Lī&scaron;ir//I&scaron;paru<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;"
