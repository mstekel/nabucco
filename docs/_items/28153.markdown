paraphrase: "Loan of silver:<strong> B</strong> owes <strong>A</strong> 2/3 mina of silver by 1/8 alloy (<em>bitqu</em>) per shekel. He will pay the silver in Nisān (I). The house of the debtor, located in (<em>ina qereb</em>) Sippar and bordering the building plot (<em>qan&ucirc;</em>) of the treasurer (<em>ma&scaron;ennu</em>) and the processional road (<em>mālaku</em>) of &Scaron;arrat-Sippar, is placed as a pledge. It is pledged to the creditor in lieu of paying interest (antichretic pledge). If these conditions are not kept, the debt bears a monthly interest of 1 shekel of silver per mina (20% p.a.). This is apart from (<em>elat</em>) the previous promissory note (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) on the basis of which <strong>A</strong> already took 1 mina of silver from <strong>B</strong>. 5 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-rēmanni/Bēl-uballiṭ//Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-bān&ucirc;nu/Nergal-u&scaron;allim//Rē&rsquo;i-sis&ecirc;; Scribe = [&hellip;]//Rē&rsquo;i-sis&ecirc;<br /> &nbsp;"
