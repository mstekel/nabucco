paraphrase: "Lease of a house in Babylon: <strong>A</strong> rents out to <strong>B</strong> a house for 3 &frac12; shekels of silver rent (<em>idū</em>) per year. The rented house is located in the city quarter <em>Ahullā qalla</em> in Babylon. It adjoins the houses of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> as well as the house of the sons of <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong>. The tenant will perform maintenance work (<em>batqu ṣabātu</em>) and renew the roof (<em>ūru &scaron;an&ucirc;</em>). For any other work he performs in the house, he can charge (<em>man&ucirc;</em>) his landlord. The tenant shall pay one half share of the rent (<em>ahi kaspi</em>) at the beginning of the year and the second half in the middle of the year. 2 witnesses (including Nab&ucirc;-mukku-elip/Bēl-zēru-ibni//Rab-ban&ecirc;) and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-uballiṭ/Iqī&scaron;a//Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-&scaron;umu-uṣur/Nab&ucirc;-zēru-uṣur//Rab-ban&ecirc;; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Ina-ṣilli-Esagil; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = &Scaron;ākin-&scaron;umi; <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-nip&scaron;ari; Scribe = Nab&ucirc;-kāṣir/&Scaron;ulāya//Nappāhu<br /> &nbsp;"
