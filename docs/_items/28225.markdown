paraphrase: "Conclusion of a litigation case: <strong>A</strong> receives in full (<em>mahāru eṭēru</em>) from <strong>B</strong> 3 1/3 minas of white cut silver (<em>kaspu peṣ&ucirc; nuhhutu</em>) by 1/8 alloy (<em>bitqu</em>) per shekel, the sum of 2 1/3 minas and 1 mina of indebted silver. Therewith the settlement between the two litigants is finished and the cutting off (<em>batāqu</em><em>) of </em>the hand (<em>rittu</em>) of <strong>B</strong> as well as the illegally seized property (<em>ṣibtētu</em>) of <strong>A</strong> are no longer an issue. 19 witnesses (including the father of <strong>B</strong>) and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Nusku-īnāya/Nusku-ayalu; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-rēmanni/Bēl-uballiṭ//Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;; Scribe = Mīnu-ana-Bēl-dān/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk//Imbu-īnāya<br /> &nbsp;"
