paraphrase: "Promissory note(?)<br /> In this very fragmentary record Iddināya should deliver barley (or dates). There is no information available on when/where/why due the tablet&#39;s fragmentary state of preservation. Names of at least 1 witness (Tabnēa/Erī&scaron;u), and the scribe: &Scaron;ullumāya/Miṣirayyu."
