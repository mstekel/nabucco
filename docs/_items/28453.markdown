paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver with antichretic pledge of slave<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 2 minas and a broken amount of shekels of medium quality white silver, of which one-eighth is alloy, to <strong>A</strong>. He pledges two of his female slaves: <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong>, on whose hand the name of the debtor&#39;s father is written and <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong>, on whose hand the debtor&#39;s own name is written. The income from their work will cover the debt (antichresis).<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib/Bēl-abu-uṣur(?); <strong>B</strong> = &Scaron;i&scaron;ku/Iddināya//Egibi; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Mu&scaron;ēzibtu, slave of <strong>B</strong> or <strong>B</strong>&#39;s father, Iddināya; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Nāru"
