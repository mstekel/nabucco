paraphrase: "Pledge of houses with antichresis. Security for a silver debt.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 1 mina and 17 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>. In the past he rented houses to his creditor&#39;s slave for refurbishing works (<em>ana epi&scaron;ānūtu</em>) (see BM31781). It is now agreed that these houses will serve as antichretic pledge for his silver debt (<em>ki hubul kaspi</em>). Accordingly, the creditor&#39;s slave who is renting the houses, should pay his rent (<em>idu</em>) to his master rather than to B (lit. A <em>ikkal [akālu]</em>). This is the arrangement till the end of the year (or: till the end of the rental period) (<em>adi qīt &scaron;anāti</em>), at which point <strong>B</strong> should pay off his debt and the houses should return to him.&nbsp; Note that the word &quot;pledge&quot; (<em>ma&scaron;kanu</em>) is not explicitly used in the text. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Bēl-iddin/Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir//<em>Rab-ban&ecirc;</em>.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-iddin/Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir//Rab-ban&ecirc;; <strong>C</strong> = Nergal-rēṣūa, slave of Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-iddin//Egibi"
