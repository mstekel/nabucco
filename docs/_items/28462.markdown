paraphrase: "Receipt for silver, payment for a share in land.<br /> Concerns a building plot (<em>qan&ucirc;</em>). <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s share in it (<em>pūt zitti</em>) is worth 52 shekels of silver.&nbsp; <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> receives (<em>mahāru</em>) exactly this amount of silver from <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, in addition (<em>adi) </em>to the 12 shekels of silver which<strong> B<sub>2</sub></strong> had given him (<em>nadānu</em>) at a previous occasion (<em>kaspu mahru</em>, lit. &ldquo;the previous money&rdquo;). Assuming that the building plot was shared by <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>, it follows that the latter sold his share for 52 shekels to <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and for 12 shekels to<strong> B<sub>2</sub></strong>. It is likely that<strong> A<sub>1</sub></strong> also sold his share, for 52 shekels (to <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>?).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Aqara//Nabāya; <strong>A</strong><strong><sub>2</sub></strong> = Marduk-&scaron;arru-uṣur/Marduk-nāṣir//Ir&rsquo;anni; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Kalbāya; <strong>B<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi"
