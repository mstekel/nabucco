paraphrase: "Fulfilment of a dowry promise.<br /> Concerning 2 kor (27000 m<sup>2</sup>) of arable land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>), 5 slaves (<em>amēluttu</em>) and household utensils, which <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> promised (<em>qab&ucirc;</em>) to <strong>B</strong> as dowry for his daughter <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>. Later, on the 1<sup>st</sup> of Addar (XII) in the 14<sup>th</sup> year of Nabonidus (i.e., after <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>᾽s death) his son <strong>A<sub>2</sub> </strong>fulfilled the promise: he gave <strong>B</strong> 2 kor (27000 m<sup>2</sup>) of arable land planted with trees located on the road to Ki&scaron;, from the Royal Road along the bank (<em>ki&scaron;ādu</em>) of the Banītu-Canal till the dike (<em>makall&ucirc;</em>) of the arable land that <strong>A<sub>2</sub> </strong>co-owns (<em>&scaron;a itti</em>) with his business partner <strong>D</strong>. He also gave <strong>B</strong> the 5 female slaves (<strong><sup>f</sup>E<sub>1</sub></strong>,<strong><sup>f</sup>E<sub>2</sub></strong>,<sup> <strong>f</strong></sup><strong>E<sub>3</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>E<sub>4</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>E<sub>5</sub>)</strong>, who were bought from the Nappahu family, and the household utensils. With regard to the slaves that <strong><sup>f</sup>F</strong> promised to <strong>B</strong>, it is agreed that <strong>B</strong> can demand (<em>bu</em><em>᾽</em><em>&ucirc;</em>) them from <strong><sup>f</sup>F</strong>. Archival evidence makes it plausible that the 2 kor are part of <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>&rsquo;s share in 6.1.3.5 kor of land which he and <strong>D</strong> co-own (see Wunsch 2000, 54). The text stipulates how the business partners should restructure their shares in the land so that <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>᾽s brother-in-law can take possession of his part in it. However the entire passage is fraud with difficulties. In translation it reads: &ldquo;according to the amount of their shares (<em>aki zitti</em>) they (i.e., <strong>A<sub>2 </sub></strong>and <strong>D)</strong> will &hellip; (uncl.: SAG.KI <em>i-&scaron;aq-q&iacute;-lu-ma</em>), and then <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>B</strong> can each take possession (<em>itti ahāme&scaron; ṣabātu</em>)&rdquo; of their parts. Each of the partners has taken a copy of the present document. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong>=Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B</strong>=Dummuqu/ Bēl-ahhē-iddin//Egibi, the groom; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>=<sup>f</sup>Qibī-dumqī-ilat, the bride, daughter of <strong>A<sub>1</sub> </strong>and sister of <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>; <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>=Itti-Marduk-balāṭu, son of <strong>A<sub>1 </sub></strong>and brother of <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>; <strong>D</strong>=Bān&ucirc;nu(/Ṣillāya//Rab-ban&ecirc;), business partner of <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>; <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong>=<sup>f</sup>Amtia; <strong><sup>f</sup>E<sub>2</sub></strong>=<sup>f</sup>&Scaron;ēpitāya; <strong><sup>f</sup>E<sub>3</sub></strong>=<sup>f</sup>Banītu-tuklat <strong><sup>f</sup>E<sub>4</sub></strong>=<sup>f</sup>Gimilinni; <strong><sup>f</sup>E<sub>5</sub></strong>=<sup>f</sup>Lā-tubā&scaron;inni; <strong><sup>f</sup>F</strong>=<sup>f</sup>Qudā&scaron;u (without affiliation)"
