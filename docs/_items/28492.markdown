paraphrase: "Fragmentary promissory note.<br /> The first two lines of the tablet are broken. But it is clear that <strong>B</strong> owes (<em>ina muhhi</em>) <strong>A </strong>an amount of silver (<em>kaspu</em>). The tablet mentions in a damaged passage a payment (<em>nadānu</em>) for work or service (<em>dullu</em>) on a ship (<em>eleppu</em>). The payment of the debt is secured by the pledge (<em>ma&scaron;kanu</em>) of <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;slave, <strong>C</strong>. Apart from the first witness, the names of the witnesses and the scribe are broken.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>=Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n, creditor; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun/Bēl-ahhē-iqī&scaron;a//Sippe, debtor; <strong>C </strong>= X-<em>r</em><em>ē</em>manni, slave of <strong>B</strong>"
