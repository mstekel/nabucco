paraphrase: "Transfer of ownership of land.<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> owns (possibly as a part of her dowry) a plot of arable land (<em>zēru</em>), situated opposite the Zababa Gate in the district (<em>pīḫatu</em>) of Babylon, which has been legally entrusted to her husband <strong>B</strong>. He received it in compensation for his claim (<em>kūm ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) against his wife, obtaining from the judges a tablet recording his right. He then pledged (<em>ma&scaron;kanu &scaron;akānu</em>) it to <strong>C</strong>, the slave (<em>qallu</em>) of <strong>D</strong>. Now, <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> offers legal ownership over the field to the slave&rsquo;s owner, in exchange for a non-specified gift (<em>qī&scaron;tu</em>). She also offers him the original document attesting the purchase (<em>ummi </em><em>eqlēti</em>, lit. &ldquo;mother of the fields&rdquo;). <strong>D</strong>, then, hands over 10 shekels of silver as a gift, and the woman gives him the original document in return, transferring (<em>mu&scaron;&scaron;uru</em>) ownership to him. <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> puts the agreement down in writing (<em>&scaron;aṭāru</em>) and gives the document to <strong>D,</strong> in order to make sure that it will not be changed in the future. Names of 3 witnesses (including Bēl-udammib/Bēl-ahhē-iddin//Egibi, <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s brother-in-law) and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Esagil-bēlet/Nādin-ahi//Eppe&scaron;-ilī, wife of <strong>B</strong>; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēre&scaron;/Tabn&ecirc;a//Ahu-bāni; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-utirri, slave of <strong>D</strong>; <strong>D</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi"
