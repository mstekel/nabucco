paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A </strong>purchases land, land planted with trees as well as newly cleared land (<em>zēru zaqpu u tapt&ucirc;</em>), from <strong>B</strong>. Because of a break at the beginning of the tablet it is not possible to get any background information about the plot, whose property was shared among members of the Egibi family. From what remains of the first lines, in fact, one understands that two members of the Egibi family, <strong>C</strong> and <strong>D</strong>, did not divide (<em>zu&rsquo;uzu</em>) it. The text provides information only on the properties adjacent to its upper and lower front sides, i.e. the bank (<em>ki&scaron;ādu</em>) of the Banītu canal on the one side and the dike (<em>makall&ucirc;</em>) of the field on the other side. <strong>B </strong>has given (<em>nadānu</em>) this field, in its entirety (<em>mādu u īṣu</em>), to <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> for 7 minas and 7 shekels of white silver in pieces (<em>kaspi peṣ&ucirc; &scaron;ibirti</em>). He acknowledges that he has received (<em>eṭēru</em>) the total amount from the buyer, and he is satisfied (<em>apālu </em>&nbsp;G Stat). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other; should someone from the Egibi family complain against this purchase, the claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the received silver. Names of witnesses and scribe lost.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Amat-Bāba/Kalbāya//Nabāya; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-udammiq/Bēl-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>D</strong> = Nergal-ēṭir/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi"
