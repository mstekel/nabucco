paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> The tablet records the purchase of agricultural land; the text has been divided into paragraphs, marked on the tablet by a line drawn at the end of each one (and indicated below in the paraphrase by LINE).<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases 0;0.2 Kor (900 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) from <strong>B</strong>: it is a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>), located in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>) at the opening of the Borsippa Canal, in front of the &Scaron;ama&scaron; Gate in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon. LINE<br /> Its upper side in the West borders on the royal marshes (<em>raqqatu &scaron;a &scaron;arri</em>) and its lower side on the East on the royal street (<em>harrān &scaron;arri</em>). Its upper front in the North borders on the buyer&rsquo;s property and its lower front in the South on (the land of) <strong>C</strong>. LINE<br /> <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent for this land together with the seller <strong>B</strong> (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>) to be 32 shekels of white silver (<em>kaspu peṣ&ucirc;</em>). He has given him the total price, plus 1 shekel of silver as additional payment (<em>k&icirc; p&icirc; atri</em>). LINE<br /> The seller acknowledges that he has received (<em>mahāru</em>) 33 shekels of white silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), corresponding to the total price for his field, and he is satisfied (<em>apālu </em>&nbsp;G Stat). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. LINE. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-uballiṭ/Zēr-Bābili//Etel-p&icirc;; <strong>C </strong>= Marduk-&scaron;umu-ibni/Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu"
