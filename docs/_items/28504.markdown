paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> Upper half of a tablet, in which only the first lines recording information on the type and surface of the purchased land are preserved. The deal concerns 0;0.4.0.9 Kor (1867,5 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) located in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>): it is a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) bearing fruit (<em>iṣṣi bilti</em>), located in the meadowland (<em>ugāru</em>) of the Bitqu-&scaron;a-Ile&rsquo;&rsquo;i-Bēl in front of the Zababa Gate in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon. Its upper long side in the West, whose length is lost in a lacuna, borders on (the property of) <strong>A</strong>, the lower side, also of an unknown length, borders on another property of someone whose name is lost. Rest of the text broken. 5 witnesses (names lost) and the scribe. The reading of <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s name is not certain, since the proper name is lost in a lacuna: the identification is suggested on the basis of his father&#39;s name.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Rēmūt?/Kurbanni-Marduk//Ea-eppe&scaron;-ilī"
