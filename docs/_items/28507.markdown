paraphrase: "House rental.<br /> The tablet records the extension of a house rental agreement with 7 years. The property is located on the field in the <em>hallat-</em>garden (<em>kir&ucirc; hallat</em>) of the temple of Bēl, spreading from the right-of-way (<em>uṣ&ucirc;</em>) to the rear part (<em>kutallu</em>) of <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s house, and it was rented from <strong>A </strong>to <strong>B</strong> for repair and maintenance work (<em>ēpi&scaron;ānūtu</em>). In three broken lines a promissory note (<em>uˀiltu</em>), the rear part (<em>kutallu</em>) of <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s house and (a property?) belonging to <strong>D</strong> are mentioned. <strong>B</strong> will receive money (maybe the silver recorded in the promissory note previously mentioned) for the building of the reed hut (<em>huṣṣu</em>). The house will be built with bricks, as the ones of the neighbours (<em>it&ucirc;</em>). The renter will live 20 years in the house. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe. The first rental agreement for this house is recorded in BM31781.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-iddin/Nergal-ēṭir//Rab-ban&ecirc;; <strong>B</strong> = Nergal-rēṣūa; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl&scaron;unu; <strong>D</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir"
