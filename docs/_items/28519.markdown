The sellers guarantee against (suits brought by) a person acting unlawfully (<em>sēh&ucirc;</em>) or a person claiming (<em>pāqirānu</em>) that <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> is a free person (<em>mār ban&ecirc;</em>). A broken passage at the end of the tablet informs that something/someone of the king (details are broken off) (wr. [..A]B?.A.ME&Scaron;), that <strong>D</strong> [and?] <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>, took (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>), has become scarce (<em>maṭ&ucirc;</em>) and they gave it back to <strong>E</strong>, the governor of the sealand (<em>&scaron;akin t&acirc;mti</em>). (The deal has been concluded) with <strong><sup>f</sup>F</strong>, <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s mother-in-law, consent (<em>ina a&scaron;ābi</em>).
