paraphrase: "Document related to a house. Very fragmentary.<br /> The tablet records the purchase of a house (l. 7, <em>&scaron;īmu</em>), for which however also the payment of a rent is mentioned (l. 3, <em>idū</em>) and the obligation to do maintenance work (<em>batqa iṣabbat </em>l. 9). The opening lines refer to judges (probably including <strong>A</strong> among them). More individuals are recorded, whose names and role in the deal cannot be determined with certainty: <strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong>. The document was written in front of 4 judges; name of the scribe: Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun//Rab-ban&ecirc;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahu-iddin//Nā<em>dinu-x</em>; <strong>C</strong> = Bān&ucirc;nu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin(//Ṣillāya? cfr. Nbn 536, so Krecher p. 163); <strong>D</strong> = <em>Nab&ucirc;-balāssu</em>-iqbi/Dayyān-Marduk (? cfr. Nbn 536, so Krecher p. 163)"
