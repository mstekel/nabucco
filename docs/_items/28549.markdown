paraphrase: "Summons to establish a case.<br /> Fragmentary: Only a few sentences of this text are readable. At the beginning, it is recorded that [<strong>A</strong>] will bring (<em>abāku</em>) his witness, who is called to establish the case (<em>k&acirc;nu &Scaron;</em>) against [<strong>B</strong>]. Then the text breaks off, when it resumes one can read &ldquo;As many days as it is established in the tablet (?)&rdquo; [...] After a lacuna, 1/3 mina and 1 shekel of silver are mentioned, which are at his (we do not know whose) disposal. Someone must (pay off?) in full the silver with its interests. He will take receipt of the tablet related to that 1/3 mina and 1 shekel of silver. Should he fail to establish the case, then <strong>C</strong> will immediately give the 1/3 mina and 1 shekel of silver back. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: <strong>D</strong>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = .../Addia//Uballiṭ-Marduk; <strong>B</strong> = [the name is broken off]; <strong>C</strong> = Addia, father of <strong>A</strong>; <strong>D</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi"
