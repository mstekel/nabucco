paraphrase: "Share-farming agreement for a donkey<br /> <strong>A</strong> allows <strong>B</strong> to use (lit. &ldquo;gives&rdquo;) his non-marked (<em>&scaron;amātu</em>) donkey mare and her suckling (<em>&scaron;a &scaron;izbu</em>) foal in return for a share (<em>ana zitti</em>) in the profits produced with the animals. His share is fixed at 1/3 mina of medium-quality silver, of which 1/8 is alloy. He has not yet received (<em>mahāru</em>) the silver from<strong> B</strong>. The share-farming agreement will run for 6 years, during which <strong>B</strong> guarantees (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) for the caretaking (<em>suddudu</em>), the fodder (<em>rītu</em>) and the guarding (<em>maṣṣartu</em>) during day and night of these animals. The two hold equal shares (<em>ahātu</em>) in offspring (<em>tamlittu</em>) and donkey foals (<em>mūru</em>). Names of 6 witnesses and the scribe: Nidinti-Bēl /Marduk-nāṣir//Eppe&scaron;-ilī. An additional, 7<sup>th</sup> witness is listed after the place and date of issue.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-aplu-iddin/Gimillu/Iranni"
