paraphrase: "Asset transfer.<br /> This tablet is a duplicate of an official document and present several syntactic problems due to a wrong or careless copying. <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong>, <strong>A<sub>4</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>5</sub></strong>, <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s sons, transmit land and slaves (<em>zēru u amīlūtu</em>) to their mother <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> under a sealed document (<em>kanāku -</em> <em>dagālu</em> &Scaron;). In this document, they swear to each other by the gods and the king that if in future one of them should receive <em>(kanāku &ndash; na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) from (<em>ina qātē</em>) their mother a share (<em>zittu</em>) of that land or those slaves that they entrusted to their mother without the other&#39;s consent (<em>la ahāmi&scaron;</em>), then &hellip; (the consequences are not written in the document: the scribe must have omitted a few lines from the original tablet). Should their mother give something (from this property) to someone else in front of them (i.e. with their consent), then he <em>will enjoy it</em> (<em>akālu</em><sup>?</sup>, wr. <em>i-ku-lu</em>). Any special arrangement (<em>riksu</em>) received by one of the brothers from his mother without the other brothers&rsquo; consent will be considered as invalid (<em>hep&ucirc;</em>).
