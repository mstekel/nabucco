paraphrase: "Receipt for compensatory payment.<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchased (<em>ina qātē &hellip; mahāru</em>) a plot of land (<em>zēru</em>) from four brothers (<strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>4</sub></strong>). The land consists of a field (<em>eqlu</em>) situated in the open country (<em>ṣēru</em>), partly an orchard (<em>kir&ucirc;</em>) planted with date palms (<em>gi&scaron;immarē zaqpu</em>) &ndash; fruit-bearing trees as well as young date palms &ndash; and partly wasteland (<em>ki&scaron;ubb&ucirc;</em>) above and below the New Channel in the district (<em>pīḫatu</em>) of Babylon. He paid the total price (whose amount is not specified in this document) in silver (<em>ana kasap gamirtu</em>), and he received from them a notary document, a receipt attesting the full payment (<em>ṭuppi apilti</em>: for this term see BaAr 2 pp. 170f). Then, he entitled <strong>C</strong> to a half share. Afterwards however, <strong>D</strong>, son of one of the sellers, raised claims against <strong>A</strong> and <strong>C</strong> as a result of a more accurate measurements of the land which apparently was bigger than what was originally calculated. Eventually, he acknowledges that he has received (<em>eṭēru</em>) a compensatory payment from the surplus of the land (<em>utru &scaron;a zēri</em>). All the parties agree that they will not go back to this issue and that in future they will not lodge claims against each other about the size of that field. 6+ witnesses and 2 scribes. Seal impressions of the scribes.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Marduk-&scaron;ākin-&scaron;umi/Marduk-ēṭir//Ēṭiru; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Iqī&scaron;a-Marduk/Marduk-ēṭir//Ēṭiru; <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-bān-ahi/Marduk-ēṭir//Ēṭiru; <strong>B<sub>4</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir-nap&scaron;āti/Marduk-ēṭir//Ēṭiru; <strong>C</strong> = Nergal-u&scaron;allim/&Scaron;umu-iddin//Ile&rsquo;&rsquo;i-Marduk; <strong>D</strong> = Ahu-iddin-Marduk/Marduk-&scaron;ākin-&scaron;umi//Ēṭiru"
