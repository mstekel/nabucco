paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> The tablet records the purchase of agricultural land; the text has been divided into paragraphs, marked on the tablet by a line drawn at the end of each one (and indicated below in the paraphrase by LINE).<br /> <strong>A </strong>purchases 6 Kor (81000 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) located in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>) from <strong>B</strong>: it is a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) bearing fruit (<em>iṣṣi bilti</em>) including a fruit garden (<em>adi</em> <em>limīti</em>) in Dūru-&scaron;a-karābī. LINE<br /> Its upper side in the North borders on (the property of) <strong>C</strong>, the lower side in the South on (the properties of) the four brothers <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong>D<sub>3</sub></strong> and <strong>D<sub>4</sub></strong>; its upper front in the West is adjacent to the bank (<em>ki&scaron;ādu</em>) of the New Canal and the lower front in the East borders on the royal <em>gizzatu</em>-land. LINE<br /> In total, 6 Kor (81000 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>), including (<em>adi</em>) the fruit garden (<em>limītu</em>). LINE<br /> <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent for this land together with the seller <strong>B</strong> (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>) to be 1 shekel of silver for each 0;0.0.0.6 Kor (45 m<sup>2</sup>) of land, for a total price of 30 minas of silver. He also gives 2 minas of silver as additional payment (<em>k&icirc; atri</em>). The total amount corresponds, thus, to 32 minas of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>). LINE<br /> <strong>B</strong> acknowledges that he has received (<em>mahāru</em>) the total amount of silver which was due to him as purchase price of his field, and he is satisfied (<em>apālu </em>&nbsp;G Stat). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. The field will be measured: should it be found smaller or larger than what was originally calculated, they will compensate each other (<em>ahāmi&scaron; apālu </em>) according to the field-price ratio (<em>mahīru</em>) they agreed upon. Names of 11 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Bēl/Nab&ucirc;-uṣur&scaron;u/Miṣirayyu; <strong>C</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Zākiru//A&scaron;kāpu; <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> = Bēl-rēmanni/Dummuqu//Miṣirayyu; <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bazūzu/Dummuqu//Miṣirayyu; <strong>D<sub>3</sub></strong> = Nidintu/Dummuqu//Miṣirayyu; <strong>D<sub>4</sub></strong> = &Scaron;addinnu/Dummuqu//Miṣirayyu"
