paraphrase: "Renouncement to claims about the purchase of a field.<br /> The text seems to be a duplicate of an original tablet, which was however poorly copied: as a result, it includes some mistakes and elisions. Two brothers who own land are mentioned: <strong>A</strong>, who purchased (lit. &ldquo;received&rdquo;, <em>mahāru</em>) 2;1.4 Kor (31500 m<sup>2</sup>) of &nbsp;grain field (<em>zēru p&icirc; &scaron;ulpu</em>) within the <em>han&scaron;&ucirc;</em>-land of <strong>B</strong>, that adjoins (<em>ana ṭāh miṣir</em>) (the land of) <strong>C</strong>, &ndash; and <strong>D</strong>, who bought 1;1.4 Kor (18000 m<sup>2</sup>) of grain field (<em>zēru p&icirc; &scaron;ulpu</em>) from <strong>E </strong>(<em>ina qātē &hellip; mahāru</em>). The second buyer had already access to 2 kor (27000 m<sup>2</sup>) of arable land (<em>zēru</em>), which was the dowry (<em>nudunn&ucirc;</em>) of his wife <strong><sup>f</sup>F</strong>. Three sellers (<strong><sup>f</sup>G<sub>1</sub></strong><sup> <strong>f</strong></sup><strong>G<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>G<sub>3</sub></strong>) agree that they will not complain to the two buyers about this land, and in his turn <strong>D</strong> will not complain to them about the remainder of the land. Names of 3+ witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = &Scaron;a-Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;ū; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-balāssu-iqbi/Nādin//Rē&scaron;-ummani; <strong>D</strong> = Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>E</strong> = Marduk-&scaron;umu-uṣur/Bēl-uballiṭ//Nappāhu; <strong><sup>f</sup>F</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Bēlessunu; <strong><sup>f</sup>G<sub>1</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Tubqitu/Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-zēri//Pahāru; <strong><sup>f</sup>G<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Abnatu/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-iddin//Ark&acirc;t-ilī;<strong> <sup>f</sup>G<sub>3</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Busasa/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-iddin//Ark&acirc;t-ilī"
