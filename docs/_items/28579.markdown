paraphrase: "Land rental.&nbsp;<br /> Concerns [x] kor of arable land located in Nuh&scaron;anitu, together with <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>&rsquo;s guardhouse and an orchard&nbsp;- land stretching from the branch of the Borsippa Canal to [&hellip;]. <strong>A</strong> received this land from <strong>C</strong> (and then) leased it to <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> from the house of Bibānu. [&hellip;] The lessor should spade it and irrigate it with floodwater. He is responsible for gardening the date palm fronds (<em>libbu</em>) and branches <em>(har</em><em>ūtu</em><em>)</em><em>.</em> He should also dig an exit(?). He guarantees for the land and the orchards; he should not cut off (<em>murr</em><em>&ucirc;</em>) the fresh dates <em>(uhinn</em><em>u</em>)<em>.</em> He should build a wall around the orchards and tilt(?) (<em>kanā&scaron;u</em>) the dam. Names of xxx witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu/Bunene-bān-zēri//Bēl-ēṭiru; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahu-rēmanni; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Qī&scaron;tia; <strong>C</strong> = Mura&scaron;&ucirc;/Iddin-Marduk//Ilia"
