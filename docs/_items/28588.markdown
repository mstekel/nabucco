paraphrase: "Purchase of a building lot.<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases 17;0.4.17 1/2 sq.r (c. 216,5 m<sup>2</sup>) of land from <strong>B</strong>: this consists of a building plot with a house in ruin in Tē, near Babylon. Given its irregular shape, the land is calculated according to two measured areas. The area of the first one covers 14 r (171,5 m<sup>2</sup>) in total: its upper long side in the West is 2 1/2;0.0.6.8 r (c. 20,66 m) long and borders on the surface area of the night guard&rsquo;s sons &ndash; the lower long side in the East, 3;0.0.2 r (c. 22 m) long, is adjacent to the way out (<em>mūṣ&ucirc;</em>) of the same field and <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s house. The lower front in the North measures 1;0.0.30 r (c. 22 m) and borders on the way out (<em>mūṣ&ucirc;</em>) of (the property belonging to) the night guard&rsquo;s sons and <strong>D</strong>; the lower front side in the South is 1;0.0.3 1/2 r (c. 8,75 m) long and borders on <strong>E</strong>&rsquo;s house. The second measured area covers 3;0.0.4.17 1/2 r (c. 45,02 m<sup>2</sup>) in total. Its upper long side in the North is 1;0.0.0.14 r (c. 7,29 m) long and is again adjacent to the way out (<em>mūṣ&ucirc;</em>) of (the property belonging to) the night guard&rsquo;s sons and <strong>D</strong>; the lower long side in the South measures 1;0.0.1.8 r (c. 7,66 m) and borders on <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s house. Its lower front in the West is 1/2;0.0.5 1/2 r (c. 6,25 m) long and is adjacent to the same field as the first measured area; the lower front side in the East, which measures 1/2;0.0.4 1/2 r (c. 5,75 m), is adjacent to the broad street. <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent for this land, 17;0.4.17 1/2 sq.r (c. 216,5 m<sup>2</sup>) in total, together with the seller <strong>B</strong> to be 18 1/3 shekels of silver for each 1/2 sq. r (12,5 m<sup>2</sup>) of land. The buyer gives (<em>nadānu</em>) the total purchase price (<em>&scaron;īmu gamru</em>) amounting to 6 2/3 minas and 2 1/3 shekels of silver, plus 8 shekels as additional payment. <strong>B </strong>acknowledges that he has received in total [...]+5 1/3 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), and he is satisfied. The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. To make sure that the agreement will not be changed, they have taken an oath by Nab&ucirc;, Marduk and the king. Names of 11 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-&Scaron;āpik-zēri/Marduk-zēru-ibni//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Ninurta; <strong>C</strong> = Gimillu/Itti-Esagila-zēri//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Ea; <strong>D</strong> = Ibnāya/Balāssu//Bā&#39;iru; <strong>E</strong> = Bānia/Nab&ucirc;-kullimanni"
