paraphrase: "Receipt of payment; purchase of land. Fragmentary.<br /><strong>A</strong> buys 6 sq. r (c. 73,5 m<sup>2</sup>) of land (<em>erṣetu</em>) from <strong>B</strong>, including a house in ruins (<em>abtu</em>) and a reed building (<em>huṣṣu</em>) located in Tē, in Babylon. Its upper long side in the North is adjacent to the broad Mutaq-Nergal-ša-hadê street, and the lower long side in the the South borders on <strong>C</strong>’s house. Its upper front in the West is adjacent to the Šullaṣu-street and the lower front in the East borders on <strong>D</strong>’s house. The last lines of the tablet are severely damaged: from what is extant, one infers that at first the field-price ratio is set out (1 2/3 minas of [silver…] per each unknown surface of land) and subsequently the full purchase price is fixed. An additional payment (<em>atru</em>) of 4 shekels of silver as well as a garment given as expenditure (<em>tēlītu</em>) is also part of the agreement. Names of the witnesses and the scribe are lost.<br />  <br /><strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nabû-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Šaddinnu/Nabû-šumu-iškun//Mandidi; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-aplu-iddin//Iddin-Marduk; <strong>D</strong> = Nabû-ēṭir-napšāti//Silīm-Bēl//Sîn-karābī-išme"
