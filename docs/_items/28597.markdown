paraphrase: "Court protocol.<br /> Concerns <strong>A,</strong> <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong>&rsquo;s slave, redeemed (<em>paṭāru </em>D) by payment of silver (partly uncl.), who in Nebuchadnezar&rsquo;s 35<sup>th</sup> regnal year, i.e. some twenty years before the trial takes place, had been pledged for 1/3 mina and 8 shekels of silver by <strong>C</strong>. He had now brought suit (<em>ragāmu</em>) claiming: &quot;I am a free person (<em>mār ban&ecirc;</em>), &nbsp;in the employment of (<em>ṣabātu</em>, lit. &quot;held by&quot;) <strong>D</strong>, the third man (<em>ta&scaron;lī&scaron;u</em>) of <strong>E<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>E<sub>2 </sub>C</strong>&rsquo;s daughter&rdquo;. They argued the case (<em>dīnu </em><em>dabābu</em>) before the chief judge (<em>sukkallu</em>), the chief officials (<em>rab&ucirc;</em>), as well as Nabonidus&rsquo; judges (<em>dayyānu</em>). They heard their matter and read the contract(s) (<em>riksu</em>) related to the slave status (<em>ardūtu</em>) of <strong>A</strong> from Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s 35<sup>th</sup> regnal year to Nabonidus&rsquo; 7<sup>th</sup> regnal year when he was (eventually) sold (to <strong>H</strong>). He had been taken as pledge (<em>ma&scaron;kanu &scaron;akānu</em>), given as a dowry to <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>F </strong>who at a later time sealed a document according to which she handed him over together with a house share to <strong>G<sub>1</sub></strong>, her son, and <strong>G<sub>2</sub></strong>, her husband. The judges asked <strong>A </strong>to show them (<em>kalāmu</em> D) evidence of his free status (<em>mār ban&ucirc;ti</em>). <strong>A </strong>answered (<em>apālu</em>) this: &ldquo;I fled twice from my master&rsquo;s house, and I hid (lit. &ldquo;I was not seen&rdquo;) for many days. Since I was afraid, I said so: &lsquo;I am a free person (<em>mār ban&ecirc;</em>)!&rsquo; But I do not hold the status of free person. I am <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s slave, redeemed by payment of silver! She has handed me over to <strong><sup>f</sup>F</strong>, her daughter, who has sealed a document according to which I belonged to <strong>G<sub>1</sub></strong>, her son, and <strong>G<sub>2</sub></strong>, her husband. Since <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s and <strong><sup>f</sup>F</strong>&rsquo;s death, I have been a slave owned (lit. &ldquo;sealed&rdquo;) for silver by <strong>H</strong>. I will go and serve (<em>palāhu</em>) my master (<em>bēlum</em>)&rdquo;. The chief judge (<em>sukkallu</em>), the chief officials (<em>rab&ucirc;</em>) and the judges (<em>dayyānu</em>) heard his testimony (<em>mukinnūtu</em>) and restored his slave status (<em>k&icirc; ardūtu turru</em>) while <strong>E<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>E<sub>2</sub></strong> (<strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s daughter), and <strong><sup>f</sup>F</strong>, who gave the dowry, were present (<em>ina uzuzzi</em>) . Names of 3 witnesses: S&icirc;n-&scaron;ēzib, the chief judge (<em>sukallu</em>), &Scaron;uma-ukīn and Nergal-ahu-uṣur, the judges; and the scribe: Ile&#39;&#39;i-Marduk//Eppe&scaron;-ili.&nbsp; Seal impression of the 2 judges and Kiribtu, the <em>kiz&ucirc;</em>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Barīki-ilāni; <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Gagāya/&hellip;, mother of <strong><sup>f</sup>F</strong>; <strong>C</strong> = Ahu-nūri/Nab&ucirc;-nādin-ahi; <strong>D</strong> = Bēl-rēmanni; <strong>E<sub>1</sub></strong> = &Scaron;ama&scaron;-udammiq/Nab&ucirc;-nādin-ahi; <strong><sup>f</sup>E<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Qudā&scaron;u/Ahu-nūri; <strong><sup>f</sup>F</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Nuptāya/Gagāya, daughter of <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong>; <strong>G<sub>1</sub></strong> = Zababa-iddin, son of <strong><sup>f</sup>F</strong>; <strong>G<sub>2</sub></strong> = Iddināya, husband of <strong><sup>f</sup>F</strong>; <strong>H</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi"
