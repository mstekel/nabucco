paraphrase: "Security for debt.<br /> <strong>B</strong>, the crownprince&#39;s (<strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s) alphabet scribe (<em>sepīru</em>), takes <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s house as a security for a debt of 1 1/2 minas of silver. The house is located near <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s house and will remain pledged for three years. <strong>B </strong>will enjoy the right of usufruct in lieu of interest (antichresis), but will caulk the roof and repair the house. After three years, <strong>A </strong>will pay off his debt of 1 1/2 mina to <strong>B</strong> and retain his house. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-apli; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-iddin/Rēmūt//Dēk&ucirc;; <strong>D</strong> = Bēl-&scaron;arru-uṣur, crown prince (<em>mār &scaron;arri</em>)"
