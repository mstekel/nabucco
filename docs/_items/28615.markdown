paraphrase: "Security for a debt. Pledge of a house with antichresis.<br /> The document concerns <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s house, which is currently pledged to <strong>B.</strong> He will enjoy the right of usufruct in lieu of interest (antichresis), but should repair the house. In Nisan (I), Ta&scaron;rīt (VII) and Kislīm (IX) he will deliver 3 baskets of <em>tābīlu-</em>herbs. The fact that the house is now pledged to <strong>B</strong> does not effect the rental agreement with <strong>C</strong> who has been paying yearly 1/2 mina and 2 shekels of silver to <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong>, as rent for this house. <strong>B</strong> is entitled to receive this rent [...] from <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong> for the 1<sup>st</sup> year. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-aplu-iddin/Balāṭu//&Scaron;a-nā&scaron;ī&scaron;u; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Kuddāya; <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-mu&scaron;ētiq-udd&ecirc;/Dayyān-Marduk//Mu&scaron;ēzib; <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bēl-uballiṭ/Lī&scaron;iru//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-parakki"
