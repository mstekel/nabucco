paraphrase: "Memorandum about a business partnership<br /> <strong>A</strong>, slave of <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> invests 5 minas and 2 &frac14; shekels of silver in a business partnership (<em>harrānu</em>) with <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>. The partners agree that <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> is entitled (<em>akālu</em>) to a share in whatever he and his partner <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> make with the mentioned silver that is equal to <strong>A</strong>&#39;s share (<em>ahu zitti</em>). <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>assume warranty for the silver. Memorandum (<em>tahsistu</em>, wr. <em>tah-hi-su</em>). Names of 2 <em>ina-u&scaron;uzzi</em> witnesses, the first one Rēmūt/Bēl-zēru-ibni who is most likely the same person as <strong>B<sub>2</sub>. </strong>The scribe&#39;s name is not spelled out. For a business partnership with the same partners, see BM31600.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nergal-rēṣūa, slave of <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>= Ea-nāṣir; <strong>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Rēmūt; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ina-Esagila-rāmat"
