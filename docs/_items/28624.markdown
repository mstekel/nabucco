Purchase price for a share in land.<br /> <strong>A</strong> has previously purchased (<em>mahīra epē&scaron;u</em>) land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>) located on a branch (<em>bābu</em>) of the old Kutha canal from <strong>B</strong>. In the present document he receives (<em>eṭēru</em>) a silver payment from his son-in-law (<strong>C</strong>) for a share (<em>zittu</em>) of 0;2.3 kor (6750 m<sup>2</sup>) in this field. The exact amount that is paid is not specified. The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each. A short note at the end of the document stipulates that they will share losses (<em>&scaron;apālu</em>) and profits (<em>&scaron;aq&ucirc;</em>) depending on the quality of the land (bad or good: <em>bī&scaron;u, babban&ucirc;</em>)<em>. </em>Names of 3 witnesses (including Nergal-ēṭir and Kalbāya: brother and adoptive brother of <strong>A</strong>) and the scribe (Kurbanni-Marduk, son-in-law of <strong>A</strong>).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = &Scaron;ama&scaron;-aplu-iddin/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-zēru-iqī&scaron;a//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;; <strong>C</strong> = Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu/Marduk-bāni-zēri//Bēl-ēṭir"
