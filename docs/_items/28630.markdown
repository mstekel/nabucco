paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> The tablet records the purchase of agricultural land which, given its irregular shape, is calculated according to two measured areas: each one of these plots is described separately, marked on the tablet by a line drawn at the end of each paragraph (and indicated below in the paraphrase by LINE).<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases 0;0.2.5.6 Kor (1320 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) located in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>) from <strong>B</strong>. It consists of a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) in the meadowland along the irrigation canal (<em>ugār namgari</em>), at the branch of the Borsippa Canal in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon. LINE<br /> The upper side in the North of the first partial surface (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>) measures 170 cubits (85 m) and borders on (the property of) <strong>C</strong>, its lower side in the South measures 162 cubits (81 m) and borders on (the property of) the buyer <strong>A</strong>. Its upper front in the West measures 23 cubits (11,5 m) and is adjacent to (the property of) <strong>D</strong>, its lower front in the East measures 25 cubits (12,5 m) and is adjacent to the royal street (<em>harrān &scaron;arri</em>). In total, this first area measures 0;0.2.1.2 Kor (990 m<sup>2</sup>). LINE<br /> The upper side in the North of the second partial surface (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>) measures 50 cubits (25 m) and borders on (the property of) <strong>C</strong>, its lower side in the South, with the same length as the upper side, borders on (the property of) <strong>A</strong>. Its upper front in the West measures 26 cubits (13 m) and is adjacent to the royal street (<em>harrān &scaron;arri</em>), its lower front in the East measures 27 cubits (13,5 m) and is adjacent to the marshes (<em>raqqatu</em>) on the bank of the Euphrates (<em>ki&scaron;ād nār Puratti</em>). In total, the second area measures 0;0.0.4.4 Kor (330 m<sup>2</sup>). LINE<br /> <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent for this land of 0;0.2.5.6 Kor (c. 1320 m<sup>2</sup>) together with the seller <strong>B</strong> (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>) to be 1 shekel of silver for each 3 3/4 gar (28,1 m<sup>2</sup>) of land. The buyer has given (<em>nadānu</em>) the total purchase price (<em>&scaron;īmi&scaron;u gamrūtu</em>) of 47 shekels of silver, plus 1 shekel as additional payment (<em>k&icirc; p&icirc; atru</em>). LINE. <strong>B </strong>acknowledges that he has received (<em>mahāru</em>) in total 48 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), and he is satisfied (<em>apālu </em>&nbsp;G Stat). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. Fingernail impressions (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller <strong>B</strong>, instead of his seal impression (<em>kunukku</em>). Names of 6 witnesses and 2 scribes.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri/Nā&#39;id-Marduk//I&scaron;pāru; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-iddin/Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-apli//Etel-p&icirc;; <strong>D</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl/Esagil-zēri//Nūr-S&icirc;n"
