paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> The tablet records the purchase of agricultural land which, given its irregular shape, is calculated according to two measured areas: each one of these plots is described separately, marked on the tablet by a line drawn at the end of each paragraph (and indicated below in the paraphrase by LINE).<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases 0;1.4.0.7 Kor (4552,5 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) located in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>) from <strong>B</strong>. It consists of cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) bearing fruit (<em>iṣṣi bilti</em>). located in front of the Zababa Gate between the city walls (<em>birīt dūrāni</em>) in the district (<em>pīḫatu</em>) of Babylon. LINE<br /> The first measured area (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>) consists of 0;0.5.4.3 kor (2572,5 m<sup>2</sup>) of arable land (<em>zēru</em>). The upper side in the North measures 160 cubits (80 m) and borders on (the property of) <strong>C</strong>; the lower side in the South measures 150 cubits (75 m) and borders on (the property of) <strong>C</strong>. The upper front in the West is 66 cubits (33 m) long and is adjacent to (the fields of) <strong>C</strong> and <strong>D</strong>; the lower front in the East is 67 cubits (33,5 m) long and is adjacent to (the property of) <strong>B</strong>.<br /> The second measured area (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>) consists of 0;0.4.2.4 kor (1980 m<sup>2</sup>) of arable land (<em>zēru</em>). The long sides have the same length, 180 cubits (90 m), the upper one in the North borders on (the property of) <strong>C</strong> and the lower one in the South is adjacent to land belonging to the same person. The front sides are also regular, both measuring 44 1/2 cubits (22, 25 m): the upper one in the West borders on (the property of) <strong>B </strong>and the lower one in the South on (the land of) <strong>C</strong>. LINE<br /> <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent for this land, 0;1.4.0.7 Kor (4552,5 m<sup>2</sup>), together with the seller <strong>B</strong> (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>) to be 3 minas and 42 1/2 shekels of silver. He gives (<em>nadānu</em>) <strong>B</strong> the total purchase price plus 5 1/2 shekels as additional payment (<em>k&icirc; atri</em>). LINE<br /> The seller acknowledges that he has received (<em>mahāru</em>) in total 3 minas and 48 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), and he is satisfied (<em>apālu </em>&nbsp;G Stat). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. In its final line, the document states that a previous document related to 0;2 kor (5400 m<sup>2</sup>) of arable land (<em>zēru</em>) has been broken (i.e. has been invalidated). Fingernail impressions (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller <strong>B</strong>, instead of his seal impression (<em>kunukku</em>). Names of 6 witnesses and 3 scribes.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-iddin/Bēl-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun//S&icirc;n-tabni; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-u&scaron;allim/Bēl-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun//S&icirc;n-tabni; <strong>D</strong> = Bēl-ibni/Arad-Bēl"
