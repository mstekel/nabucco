paraphrase: "House rental.<br /> <strong>A</strong> rents houses located in front of (<em>panāt</em>) the Gi&scaron;&scaron;u-Gate, which he received (i.e. purchased, <em>mahāru</em>) from <strong>C</strong>, to <strong>B</strong> for 3 years, at a yearly price of 1/2 mina and 6 shekels of silver. It is agreed that half of the silver should be paid at the beginning of the year, and the remainder in the middle. The renter should caulk (<em>&scaron;an&ucirc;</em>) the roof and repair the wall foundations (<em>asurr&ucirc;</em>). He should also pay for the additional payment (<em>nūptu</em>) in Nisan (I), D&ucirc;zu (IV) and Kislīm (IX). The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Mura&scaron;&ucirc;/Aplāya//Ir&rsquo;anni; <strong>C</strong> = Ipria"
