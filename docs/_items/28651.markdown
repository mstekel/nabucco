paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver without interest. Pledge of land.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 1 mina and 15 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>, slave of <strong>C</strong>, to be delivered without interest in D&ucirc;zu (IV) &ndash; which happens to be the month in which the present document is written. The debtor secured the payment a month earlier by pledging his arable land located in front of the Gi&scaron;&scaron;u-gate next to&nbsp; to <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s (property). This plot of land remains pledged to <strong>A</strong> till he has been repaid the full amount of his silver. A previous promissory note for 1 mina of silver is to be considered invalid (lit. &ldquo;broken&ldquo;). Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-uterri, slave of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēre&scaron;/Tabnēa//Ahu-bāni; <strong>C</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>D</strong> = &Scaron;umāya/S&icirc;n-nāṣir&nbsp;"
