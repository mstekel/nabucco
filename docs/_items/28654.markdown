paraphrase: "Land rental: additional provisions.<br /> <strong>A</strong> has rented arable land (<em>zēru</em>) located on the Harru-&scaron;a-Zabunu to <strong>B</strong>, who should perform gardening work (<em>nukaribbūtu</em>). In this document a few additional provisions are added to the original agreement: the renter should hoe (<em>her&ucirc;</em>) the ground with an iron shovel (<em>ina marri parzilli</em>) till the end of Ṭebēt (X). Then, he will measure (<em>ma&scaron;āhu</em>) the spaded ground and hand it back to the landlord. <strong>A</strong> will deduct (<em>maqātu</em> &Scaron;) 7 kor (1260 l) of dates from the harvest to settle a debt that <strong>B</strong> still owes to him, and will pay the gardener&#39;s remuneration (<em>&scaron;issinnu</em>) which is due to the renter from what remains after this deduction (<em>&scaron;a ana la at&acirc;ru)</em>.Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe. The rental agreement for this land is recorded in BM31035.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-iddin/Kināya"
