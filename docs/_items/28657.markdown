paraphrase: "Promissory note for dates.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 160;0.0.0 kor of dates to <strong>A</strong>, to be delivered in two installments. He should first deliver 100;0.0.0 kor in Arahsamna (VIII), and the remainder in .... (the month is perhaps Ta&scaron;rīt [VII], but uncertain). Delivery is in the 36 liters measure in the creditor&#39;s courtyard (<em>haṣāru</em>) at the Borsippa canal. The debtor has two earlier promissory notes. Any previous promissory note or any document (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) about debts to <strong>C</strong> which may turn up in <strong>A</strong>&#39;s house are to be considered annulled (lit. &quot;belong to <strong>B</strong>&quot;). <strong>C</strong> received (<em>eṭēru</em>) his silver (<em>kasap ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>). Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe: Ea-aplu-iddin/<em>Mu&scaron;ēzib</em>-<em>Marduk//Ṭābih</em>-kāri.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Niqudu; <strong>C</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya"
