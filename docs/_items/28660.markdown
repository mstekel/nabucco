paraphrase: "Addendum to a slave sale.<br /> <strong>A</strong> sold his slave <strong>C </strong>to<strong> B</strong> for 1 mina and 1 shekel of silver (cf. MMA 79.7.5). At the moment the slave is not with the seller (the reason is not mentioned in the text): when<strong> C</strong> will be seen (<em>amāru </em>Ntn) in <strong>A&#39;</strong>s presence (<em>ina p</em><em>āni</em>), <strong>A</strong> should compensate <strong>B</strong> (<em>mandattu nadānu</em>) for the loss of income from the absent slave. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Arrabi/Adad-ahhē-&scaron;ullim; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-natanu"
