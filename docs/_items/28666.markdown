paraphrase: "Sale of slaves.<br /> <strong>A</strong> gave his slaves (<em>lamutānu</em>) <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> to <strong>B </strong>(as security) for (a debt of) 2 minas and 10 shekels of silver, from Ta&scaron;rīt (VII) of Nabonidus 8<sup>th</sup> regnal year. <strong>A</strong> set the term (<em>adannu</em>) for the payment to (<em>adi qīt</em>) the end of Ulūl (VI) of Nabonidus 9<sup>th</sup> regnal year &ndash; i.e. within one year. This term has passed by (<em>etēqu</em>) and he cannot pay (<em>kaspu &scaron;a eṭēri la ī&scaron;i</em>). Thus <strong>A</strong>, suggests (<em>qab&ucirc;</em>) the following to his creditor: &quot;(Since) there is no silver to pay off (the debt), take (<em>abāku</em>) <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> under the condition (<em>ana</em>) of a sale document (<em>ṭuppi &scaron;īmi gamrūti</em>.).&quot; <strong>B</strong> having agreed,<strong> A</strong> of his own free will, sells the two slaves to him for 2 mina and 10 shekels of silver: he also guarantees against (suits brought by) a person acting unlawfully (<em>sēh&ucirc;</em>) or a person claiming (<em>pāqirānu</em>) that the slaves are royal slaves (<em>arad &scaron;arrūtu</em>) or free persons (<em>mār ban&ecirc;</em>). Names of 4 witnesses (including <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s wife) and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nidintu/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;arra-uṣur; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nūr-&Scaron;ama&scaron;; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Nab&ucirc;"
