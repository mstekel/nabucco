paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Antichretic pledge of a house.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 2 &frac12; minas of silver to <strong>A</strong>. The debtor&rsquo;s house located next to <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s house is pledged to the creditor for two years in lieu of paying interest (antichretic pledge). Thus, the creditor does not have to pay house rent. Apart from this silver debt, <strong>A </strong>may not give silver to <strong>B</strong> without informing<strong> B</strong>&rsquo;s brother (<strong>D</strong>), otherwise he will lose that silver. Furthermore, <strong>A</strong> should not leave the house without <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s permission. Names of 4 witnesses and in the presence (<em>ina a&scaron;ābi</em>) of <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s mother. Scribe&#39;s name: <em>&Scaron;</em><em>umu-i&scaron;kun</em>/Nergal-a&scaron;arēdu//Rē&#39;i-sīs&ecirc;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nergal-u&scaron;ezib/&hellip;-zu; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi;<strong> C</strong> = Bēl-iddin/Rēmūt/Edku; <strong>D</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi, brother of <strong>B</strong>"
