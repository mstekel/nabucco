paraphrase: "Asset transfer.<br /> <strong>A</strong>, of his own free will (<em>ina hūd libbi&scaron;u</em>), transmits all his assets to his father <strong>B</strong> under a sealed document (<em>kanāku -</em> <em>dagālu</em> &Scaron;). The property consists of all that <strong>C</strong>, his mother&rsquo;s father, and <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong>, the mother of his grandmother <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong>, left to <strong>F</strong> (son of their daughter) as recorded in a sealed document. Now, <strong>A</strong> transfers the property of all the assets described in that previous document issued by <strong>C</strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>D </strong>&ndash; including fields (<em>eqlu</em>), houses (<em>bītu</em>) and slaves (<em>amīlūtu</em>) &ndash; to his father <strong>B</strong>, for ever (<em>ana ūmī ṣ&acirc;ti</em>). As long as <strong>A</strong> will live, these fields, houses, slaves and all his property (<em>nikkassu</em>) will remain at his disposal, as established in the tablet. The text ends with the usual curse formulas against whomever will change the words written in the agreement. Names of 5 witnesses and the scribe: &Scaron;ama&scaron;-zēru-u&scaron;ab&scaron;i/Zāriqu-zēri//Rab-ban&ecirc;.<br /> The tablet is oriented in a landscape format, and it is not sealed: no doubt it is a copy made for the Egibi family.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-aplu-iddin/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-aplu-uṣur//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;; <strong>B</strong> = &Scaron;ama&scaron;-aplu-uṣur/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-ina-tē&scaron;&ecirc;-ēṭir//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;, father of <strong>A</strong>; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-balāssu-iqbi/Nūrēa//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;, grandfather of <strong>A</strong>;<sup> <strong>f</strong></sup><strong>D</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Kabtāya, mother of <strong><sup>f</sup>E;</strong> <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Amat-Ninlil, grandmother of <strong>A</strong>; <strong>F</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-aplu-iddin, nephew of <strong>A</strong>"
