paraphrase: "Exchange of land with equalizing payment.<br /> The document records the exchange (<em>ṭuppu &scaron;up&ecirc;ltu</em>) of land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>) and a grain field (<em>p&icirc; &scaron;ulpu</em>) that <strong>A</strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> have switched with each other (<em>ahāmi&scaron; &scaron;up&ecirc;lu</em>).<br /> The first land, which belongs to <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong>, consists of 6 Kor (81000 m<sup>2</sup>), partly land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>) and partly cultivated as well as newly cleared land (<em>mēre&scaron;u u tapt&ucirc;</em>) located above and below the New Canal&nbsp; in front of the Enlil Gate in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon. Its upper side borders on (the property of) <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong>, an oblate (<em>&scaron;irku</em>) of Marduk, its lower side on (the property of) <strong>A</strong> and his brothers. The second property, owned by <strong>A</strong>, consists of 2 Kor (27000 m<sup>2</sup>) of land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>) located above and below the Zalmunitu ditch (<em>harru</em>) in front of the Ebi&scaron;u Gate, in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Dilbat. Its upper side is adjacent to (the property of) <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong>, the Aramaean, its lower side borders on (the propery of) <strong>E<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>E<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>E<sub>3</sub></strong>; its upper front is adjacent to (the property of) <strong>F</strong> and the lower front to (the property of) <strong>G<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>G<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>G<sub>3</sub></strong>.<br /> <strong>A</strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> exchange these fields with each other (<em>ahāmi&scaron; &scaron;up&ecirc;lu</em>). Accordingly, <strong>A</strong> takes possession (<em>ana muhhi el&ucirc;</em>) of the land on the New Canal and <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> of the one in Dilbat. Since A only gives 2 kor of land &nbsp;but receives 6 kor, he has to compensate for the difference (<em>takpu&scaron;tu</em>), by paying 4 minas of medium quality silver, of which 1/8 is alloy, to <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong>. However, this payment is in a sense fictive, because <strong><sup>f</sup>B </strong>eventually never got the silver, even if the text explicitly states that she received it (<em>eṭēru</em>). In fact, 2 minas and 30 shekels <strong>A</strong> could keep to cover <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong>&#39;s debt to him (for which he already took the house near <strong>I</strong> &#39;s house as pledge (<em>ma&scaron;kanu ṣabātu</em>);&nbsp; the remaining 1 mina and 30 shekels of white silver (<em>kaspa peṣ&ucirc;</em>) are given to <strong><sup>f</sup>K</strong>, the creditor (<em>rā&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) of <strong><sup>f</sup>B </strong>and her husband <strong>H</strong>. <strong>L</strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong>&rsquo;s brother, guarantees that <strong>H</strong>&#39;s daughter will not complain (<em>lā ragāmu</em>) about the silver that A receives as as equalizing payment (<em>takpu&scaron;tu</em>) from <strong><sup>f</sup>B. </strong>The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each.
