paraphrase: "Undertaking to stand warranty as long as the original guarantor is abroad.<br /> <strong>A</strong> stands warranty for her husband <strong>B</strong> as long as his brother <strong>C</strong> has not yet returned from the other side (<em>ahulla</em>) of the river. When he returns, she will bring him to PN (name broken off) and hand him over to him (<em>abāku &ndash; nadānu</em>). Names of 2 witnesses: &Scaron;alammānu/Baltumu, a royal merchant (<em>tamkar &scaron;arri</em>), and Bēl-ēṭir/Nergal-abu-uṣur; and the scribe: Nab&ucirc;-zēru-iddin/I&scaron;&scaron;ar-iddin. The text may belong to the Egibi archive. There is an Aramaic epigraph: <em>pnbṭm</em> פנבטם<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Burā&scaron;u (without affiliation); <strong>B </strong>= Ilī-qan&ucirc;a (without affiliation); <strong>C</strong>= Pān-Nab&ucirc;-ṭēmu, brother of <strong>B</strong>"
