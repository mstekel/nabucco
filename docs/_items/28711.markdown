Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: &Scaron;umāya/&Scaron;ulāya//Itinnu.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = &Scaron;umu-iddin/Marduk-&scaron;arrani//&Scaron;allala; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-ibni; <strong>D</strong> = Nergal-rēṣūa&nbsp;"
