paraphrase: "Court protocol: litigation about a house.<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> has brought a suit against <strong>B</strong> in front of <strong>C</strong> and the other judges because of a house that she bought with money she borrowed (<em>habātu </em>D) from <strong>B.</strong> The house is located on the Hubur Street, near <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s house (which was given to <strong>E</strong>, the Persian), and near the house of <strong>F</strong>, <strong>G</strong>&rsquo;s slave. <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> has the purchase document (<em>ṭuppu bīti</em>) that proves her title to this house. Now <strong>B</strong> wants to be paid back, and therefore he is summoned to testify (<em>ana dīni abālu </em>D) in his own case (<em>eli ramāni&scaron;u k&acirc;nu</em> D). The text at the end is slightly broken but eventually&nbsp; it is stated that the house belongs to <strong>B</strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> has no share in it. Names of 12 witnesses (including <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s brother, Nergal-u&scaron;ēzib) and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ina-Esagila-rāmat/Zēria//Nabāya; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Itti- Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu; <strong>D</strong> = Zumbāya/Mu&scaron;allim-Marduk; <strong>E</strong> = Part&acirc;mu, the Persian; <strong>F</strong> = Girāya; <strong>G</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-bān-ahi&nbsp;"
