paraphrase: "Fragmentary promissory note.<br /> Most of the tablet is broken. Only one sentence can be reconstructed. This is that he (name broken) shall pay the silver in Babylon in Addar (XII). Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n acts as witness. The names of the other witnesses and the scribe are broken.&nbsp;"
