paraphrase: "Distribution of land: fields plan.<br /> The text provides details for the allocation of land: on the obverse of the tablet there is a plan that shows six plots of land separated by a canal, with the exact measurements of the lenght for each one of their sides and the total surface areas. On the edges of the tablets there are the neighbouring properties. The reverse records how these shares are assigned to two individuals, an uncle and his nephew.<br /> <strong>A</strong> takes possesion (<em>ṣabātu</em>) of the upper share (<em>zittu elītu</em>), which is located above and below the New Canal and that borders the land of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>, an oblate (<em>&scaron;irku</em>) of Marduk, <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> und <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong>. The surface area is described in detail in the first lines of the reverse: the area above the canal consists of 1;0.2.4.2 kor (14715 m<sup>2</sup>) of land (<em>zēru</em>) of which 0;3.2.5.2 kor (9390 m<sup>2</sup>) are land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>) &ndash; while the area below the canal consists of 5;1.2.2.5 kor (71287,5 m<sup>2</sup>) of land (<em>zēru</em>), of which 1;1.5.3.8 kor (18735 m<sup>2</sup>) are land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>). This calculation includes also the area between the fields (<em>adi birat</em>).<br /> <strong>B</strong>, the nephew, takes possesion (<em>ṣabātu</em>) of the lower share (<em>zittu &scaron;aplītu</em>), which is also located above and below the New Canal and that borders the land of <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong>. The surface area of this share is described in detail in the opening lines of the reverse: the area above the canal consists of 1;0.2.3.6 kor (14670 m<sup>2</sup>) of land (<em>zēru</em>), of which 0;3.2.2.6 kor (9195 m<sup>2</sup>) are land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>) &ndash; while the area below the canal consists of 5;0.5.4.5 kor (70087,5 m<sup>2</sup>) of land (<em>zēru</em>) of which 1;2.1.5.5 (19762,5 m<sup>2</sup>) are land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>). As in the previous case, these numbers include the area between the fields (<em>adi birat</em>).<br /> <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> promise that they will not withhold (<em>kal&ucirc;</em>) water nor access to the land (<em>m&ecirc; u muṣ&ucirc;</em>) to each other; the text records that they have taken one copy of the document each. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> The land assigned to <strong>A</strong> corresponds to plots 1a, 2a and 3a while <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s share corresponds to 1b, 2b and 3b in Wunsch&rsquo;s drawing (Wunsch 2000, vol. 1, p. 195). The detailed contract for this deal is recorded in BM30365 + BM32216.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nergal-ēṭir; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-uballiṭ/Ku&scaron;&scaron;āya, oblate (<em>&scaron;irku</em>) of Marduk; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Tabnēa/Nab&ucirc;-aplu-iddin; <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-tabni-uṣur/Rēmūt; <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Barsippītu/Arad-Marduk//Ile&#39;&#39;i-Marduk"
