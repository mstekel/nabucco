paraphrase: "House rental: receipt of rental payment.<br /> <strong>A</strong> confirms that he has received an unknown amount of silver (the amount is lost in a lacuna) from <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s slave, as rental payment for his house from [x] (details lost) to Ta&scaron;rīt (VII) of an unknown Cambyses&rsquo; regnal year. Kislīm (IX) is mentioned in a broken context. The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each. Names of x witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu/&Scaron;ar-ahhē&scaron;u//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-uballiṭ/&hellip;, slave of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>C</strong> = Iqbi-Bēl"
