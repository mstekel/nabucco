paraphrase: "Purchase of land: agreement upon the price and the yield.<br /> The document has been written to finalise the deal between <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> and her brother <strong>B</strong>, after she acquired a field from him. The plot consists of 0;1.1.3 Kor (2275 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>), a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) bearing fruit (<em>iṣṣi bilti</em>) in front of the Ura&scaron; Gate.<br /> Its upper side is adjacent to the course (<em>alku</em>) of the Madānu Canal, its lower side borders on (the property of) <strong>C</strong>; its upper front borders on (the property of) <strong>D</strong> and its lower front is again adjacent to <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s land. <strong>B</strong> acknowledges that he has given (<em>nadānu</em>) this land, all of it, to his sister <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> for 35 shekels of silver as <em>hariṣu-</em>price &ndash; as established in a tablet (<em>k&icirc; ṭuppi</em>) that <strong>E</strong>, the royal scribe (<em>ṭup&scaron;arru &scaron;a &scaron;arri</em>), has sealed (<em>kanāku</em>). <strong>B</strong> has taken an oath (<em>tam&ucirc;</em>) by the gods Bēl and Nab&ucirc; to ensure that he did not act treacherously (<em>niklu nakālu</em>) by overrating (<em>&scaron;aq&ucirc; </em>D) the silver. One final clause establishes that the yield (<em>ebūru</em>) of Nabonidus&rsquo; 16<sup>th</sup> year belongs to <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong>. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Bu&rsquo;itu/Nab&ucirc;-bān-ahi//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Gula; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-&scaron;umu-ibni/Nab&ucirc;-bān-ahi//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Gula; <strong>C</strong> = Tabnēa; <strong>D</strong> = Bēl-iddin; <strong>E</strong> = Ṣillāya, royal scribe (<em>ṭup&scaron;arru &scaron;a &scaron;arri</em>)"
