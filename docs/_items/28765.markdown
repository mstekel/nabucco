paraphrase: "Sale of a slave.<br /> <strong>A</strong>, of his own free will, sells his female slave <strong><sup>f</sup>C </strong>to<strong> B</strong>. The total purchase price amounts to 1 1/3 mina and 5 shekels of silver. The remainder of the text is broken off, including the list of witnesses and the scribe&#39;s name. A short remark after the date and place of issue points out that <strong>A</strong>&#39;s name is written (<em>&scaron;aṭāru</em>) on the slave&#39;s wrist(?) in cuneiform and alphabetic script (<em>akkād&icirc;tu u ahlamāti</em>). See also Liv019.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-ahu-uṣur/&Scaron;ilāya; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Miṣatu"
