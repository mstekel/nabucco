paraphrase: "Renewal of the pledge of a slave to secure a silver debt.<br /> <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and his wife (<strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong>) owe a broken amount of silver to <strong>A</strong>. The debtors&rsquo;&nbsp; slave, who had already been pledged to the creditor for an earlier promissory note, will remain pledged. No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged slave until the debt is fully repaid. <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong> acts as guarantors for the payment. In addition, the debtors&rsquo;s earlier debt is still pending, and the same is true for a debt owed by the guarantors (<strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong>) that is secured by their mutual warranty.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = &Scaron;ama&scaron;-&scaron;umu-iddin/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Etellu; <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Amtia, wife of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>C<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Ardia; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong>= <sup>f</sup>Tapa&scaron;&scaron;ara, wife of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>"
