His brother (<strong>D</strong>) was not present (<em>qerēb</em>u) at the sale. He arranged that the sale document be written in <strong>D</strong>&#39;s name, his brother, and also the promissory note about 39 shekels which the buyer had still to pay was issued in <strong>D</strong>&#39;s name. <strong>E</strong> guaranteed for the female slave. Eventually, the sale is annulled so that <strong>D</strong> gets his slave back and <strong>B</strong>, the buyer, can ask for repayment (<em>bu&#39;&#39;&ucirc;</em> &ndash; <em>esēru</em>) of his silver from <strong>A</strong>.&nbsp; The promissory note for the remainder of the purchase price, 39 shekels, has been returned by <strong>D</strong> to<strong> B</strong>.
