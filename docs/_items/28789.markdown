paraphrase: "Sale of one or more slaves. Very fragmentary.<br /> The beginning of the tablet is broken off, thus it is impossible to know how many slaves are sold. From what is extant it is clear that <strong>A</strong> sells someone to <strong>B</strong>, and he is also the one who guarantees against (suits brought by) a person acting unlawfully (<em>sēh&ucirc;</em>) or a person claiming (<em>pāqirānu</em>) that the slave(s) is(are) a free person(s) (<em>mār ban&ecirc;</em>). Names of 2+ witnesses; name of the scribe broken off.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-uṣur&scaron;u/Balāṭu//Miṣirāya; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n"
