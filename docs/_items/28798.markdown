paraphrase: "Deposition before witnesses about a delivery.<br /> The tablet is badly preserved. <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s deposition is very fragmentary. Legible are the words barley (<em>uṭṭatu</em>), due from (<em>ina muhhi</em>), his impost (<em>imittu</em>), a blade of a plough (<em>&scaron;innu</em>), and twice the verb &quot;I gave&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Apart from (<em>elat</em>) this, nothing is charged against him.<br /> Up to (<em>adi</em>) &hellip; I will deliver (<em>nādanu</em>) to <strong>PN</strong> and will place it &hellip; After the list of witnesses, the name of the scribe, date and place <strong>A</strong> states that he sold (it) (<em>ana kaspi nadānu</em>) before Arahsamna (VIII) in the 19<sup>th</sup> year. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe: &Scaron;irku/Iddināya//Egibi.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong>=Iddin-Bēl/Balāṭu//Rab&hellip;"
