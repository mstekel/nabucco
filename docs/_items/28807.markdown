paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Antichretic pledge of a slave.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes &frac12; minas of silver to <strong>A</strong>. The payment is secured by the pledge of the debtor&rsquo;s slave (<strong>C</strong>). <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s income from the slave&rsquo;s work pays for the interest (antichresis) and he is exempt from paying rent for the slave. Should the pledged slave go to another place, the debtor shall pay 3 liters (<em>q&ucirc;</em>) of barley on a daily basis to <strong>A</strong> as compensatory payment (<em>mandattu</em>) for his loss of income from the absent slave. The document no doubt belongs to the Egibi/Nūr-S&icirc;n archive. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe: S&icirc;n-erība/S&icirc;n-ahu-iddin.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = &Scaron;ullumu/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl; <strong>B</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Ardia//Ēṭiru; <strong>C </strong>= Madān-&scaron;arru-uṣur, slave of <strong>B</strong>"
