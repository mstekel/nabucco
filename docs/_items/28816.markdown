paraphrase: "Asset transfer.<br /> <strong>A</strong>, of his own free will (<em>ina hūd libbi&scaron;u</em>), transfers (<em>dagālu </em>&Scaron;, emendation) the ownership of his assets to his son <strong>B</strong>. The property consists of 1 sq. kor (c. 13500 m<sup>2</sup>) of arable land (<em>zēru</em>), a field planted with date palms (<em>eqel gi&scaron;immarē zaqpu</em>) bearing fruit (<em>iṣṣi bilti</em>), and 2 sq. kor (c. 27000 m<sup>2</sup>) of a plot of ploughed land (<em>eqel mēre&scaron;u</em>). The total amount corresponds to 3 kor (c. 40500 m<sup>2</sup>) of arable land (<em>zēru</em>): this is located in Til-bēl&scaron;unu, in the district (<em>pīhātu</em>) of Babylon, from the bank of the Euphrates for a total extension (<em>&scaron;alāmu </em>G) of 3 kor (c. 40500 m<sup>2</sup>) of land cultivated with trees and grain (<em>zēru zaqpu u mēre&scaron;u</em>). This property had been given in exchange for (<em>kūm</em>) arable land (<em>zēru</em>) located at the outlet (<em>bābu</em>) of the Old Kutha Canal that belonged to&nbsp;<strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>&rsquo;s (i.e. <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s wife) dowry, who died (lit: &ldquo;whom the destiny has carried away, <em>&scaron;a &scaron;īmtu abālu</em>). In the final, fragmentary section of the text there is reference to another plot of land: this was sold (<em>ana kaspi nadānu</em>) by <strong>A</strong> to <strong>D</strong> and apparently was shared by <strong>E</strong> and his brothers. Then, someone&rsquo;s daughter is mentioned: she seems to obtain the property of something (<em>dagālu</em> &Scaron;), but details are lost because of the poor state of conservation of the lower part of this tablet. Names of 5 witnesses and the scribe: Kabti-ilī-Marduk//Atkuppu.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = &Scaron;ama&scaron;-aplu-uṣur/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-ina-tē&scaron;&ecirc;-ēṭir//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-aplu-iddin, son of <strong>A</strong>; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Amat-Ninlil(//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;), wife of <strong>A</strong>; <strong>D</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>E</strong> = Nergal-u&scaron;allim (without affiliation, probably Nergal-u&scaron;allim//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron; and a brother of either <strong>A</strong> or his wife. <strong>E</strong>&#39;s son, Nab&ucirc;-rēmanni, is among the witnesses).&nbsp;"
