paraphrase: "About the purchase of land: provisions for measurement and possible adjustment of purchase price.<br /> Two brothers, <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, sell land, which they own together. <strong>A</strong> sells 1 Kor (13500 m<sup>2</sup>) of land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>) located on the New Canal, including <strong>B</strong>&lsquo;s share (<em>zittu</em>), to <strong>C</strong>; <strong>B</strong> sells 1 Kor (13500 m<sup>2</sup>) of land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>) in Bīt-Hahhuru, including <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s share, to <strong>D</strong>. The brothers will measure (<em>ma&scaron;āhu</em>) these fields and, should they be found larger or smaller, they will compensate each other (<em>ahāmi&scaron; apālu</em>). Apparently there are some doubts about the size of the second plot and therefore <strong>B </strong>should (re-)measure (<em>ma&scaron;āhu</em>) the entire land in Bīt-Hahhuru and, should <strong>A</strong>&#39;s share in it be found larger or smaller than 1 kor, the brothers will compensate each other (<em>ahāmi&scaron; apālu</em>) according to their shares (<em>zīzātu</em>). The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each. Names of 11 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nergal-u&scaron;ēzib/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-iddin/S&icirc;n-ēre&scaron;//Ibni-ilu; <strong>D</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Bēl&scaron;unu//Ṭābih-kāri"
