paraphrase: "Receipt for silver. Purchase price for a house.<br /> <strong>A </strong>has purchased (<em>ina qātē mahāru</em>) a built house (<em>bītu ep&scaron;u</em>) of 7;0.5.18 gi (c. 85 m<sup>2</sup>) on behalf of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and his wife <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong> from <strong>B</strong>. The house is located in the garden belt (<em>erṣet kir&ucirc;ti</em>) of Borsippa. <strong>A</strong> paid (<em>nadānu</em>) the full purchase price (<em>gamru</em>), 11 &frac12; minas of silver, with silver he got from <strong>C<sub>1</sub> </strong>and<strong> <sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong>. However, he is not entitled to the house, nor to the silver. He gave the sale document that he sealed (with the seller) in name of <strong>C<sub>1</sub> </strong>and<strong> <sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong>. Should a copy of this sealed sale document or any other legal document (<em>riksu) </em>about this house be found in <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s house or elsewhere, it belongs to <strong>C<sub>1</sub> </strong>and<strong> <sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Madān-&scaron;umu-iddin/Zēria//Nabāya; <strong>B</strong> = Ibāya/Ṣillāya//Nagāru; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Apla-dād-natan/Addia; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Bunanītu/Hariṣāya, wife of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>"
