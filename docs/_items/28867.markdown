paraphrase: "Receipt for dates and barley. Payment of two separate debts.<br /> Concerns the debt (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) of 24 kor of dates that <strong>B</strong> owes to <strong>A</strong> and for which there exists a written agreement <em>(&scaron;aṭaru</em>) with respect to the terms for repayment (<em>adannu ana eṭēri</em>). <strong>A</strong> receives (<em>eṭēru</em>) the 24 kor of dates and its interest from <strong>B</strong>. He undertakes to bring the promissory note about this debt and return it to <strong>B</strong> (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;-nadānu</em>) before the end of Arahsamna (VIII). Concerning another debt<br /> The present document also mentions a debt (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) of 4;1.1 kor of barley that <strong>C</strong> owes to <strong>B</strong>, who receives payment (<em>eṭēru</em>) for it from <strong>A</strong>. The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each. Names of 8 witnesses and the scribe: Nab&ucirc;-balāssu-iqbi//Dābibi.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-bullissu/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-uṣur//Bēl-aplu-uṣur; <strong>B </strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>C </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-zēri/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-lī&scaron;ir//Bēl-aplu-uṣur"
