paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases 1 Kor (13500 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) from <strong>B</strong>: it is a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) located in Qalunu, in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Kutha. Its upper side borders on the field which is part of <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s dowry (<em>nudunn&ucirc;</em>) and its lower side on (the property of) the sons of <strong>E</strong>; its upper front is adjacent to uncultivated (<em>lā zaqpi</em>) waterlogged land (<em>kal&ucirc;</em>) and its lower front borders on (the property of) <strong>F</strong>. The seller, <strong>B</strong>, shares the property of this land together with his younger brother <strong>C</strong>. <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent for this land together with the seller (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>) to be 1 shekel of silver for each 7 1/2 GAR (56,25 m<sup>2</sup>), for a total purchase price (<em>&scaron;īmi&scaron;u gamrūtu</em>) corresponding to 4 minas of silver. <strong>B</strong> acknowledges that he has received (<em>mahāru</em>) 1 mina and 40 shekels from <strong>A</strong>. It is followed by a remark concerning 2 minas of silver [&hellip;] (owed) to <strong>G</strong>, who has taken this field as a pledge (<em>ma&scaron;kanu</em>). After they will have measured (<em>ma&scaron;āhu</em>) this field and sealed the tablet (<em>kanāku</em>), <strong>A</strong> will give 20 shekels, what remains of the purchase price, to <strong>B</strong>. They have taken an oath (<em>zakāru</em>) by the gods and the king. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nergal-zēru-ibni/Nergal-uballiṭ//Sagdidi; <strong>C</strong> = Taqī&scaron;a-Gula/Nergal-uballiṭ//Sagdidi; <strong>D</strong> = Balāṭu/Kudurru; <strong>E</strong> = Ṭābiḫu; <strong>F</strong> = Kabtia/Nādin//Suhāya; <strong>G</strong> = Bēl-iddin"
