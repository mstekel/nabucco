paraphrase: "Measurement of plots of land.<br /> The tablet records the result of the measurement of a large plot of land, about 1225 km long and 17,5 m wide, which for the purpose of calculation has been divided into seven smaller plots because of its irregular surface.<br /> 1) Long sides in the West and the East: 700 cubits (350 m). Upper front in the North along the bank (<em>ki&scaron;ādu</em>) of the Banītu-Canal: 35 cubits (17,5 m). Lower front in the South bordering on the next plot (<em>libbū eqli</em>): 32 2/3 cubits (c. 16,3 m).<br /> 2) Long sides in the West and the East: 300 cubits (150 m). Upper front in the North bordering on the first measured area (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>): 32 2/3 cubits (c. 16,3 m).
