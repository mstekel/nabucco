paraphrase: "House rental.<br /> <strong>A</strong> rents a house located at the head (<em>qaqqadu</em>) of the bridge (<em>gi&scaron;ru</em>) in Borsippa to <strong>B</strong>, for a yearly rental price amounting to 1/2 mina and 5 shekels of silver. <strong>B</strong> will pay the rent for this house to the landlord this month (ITI-<em>&agrave;m</em>). A short remark at the very end of the document (after the list of witnesses and the date) seems to pick this issue up again by pointing out that &quot;till(?) ([<em>a</em>]-<em>di</em>) the 2<sup>nd</sup> of Iyyar (II), i.e. the day of recording this document, the rent has (or has not yet) been paid: there is no verb. The passage may need to be collated. The renter should caulk (<em>&scaron;an&ucirc;</em>) the roof and repair the wall foundations (<em>asurr&ucirc;</em>). <strong>A</strong> will be charged (<em>man&ucirc;</em>) for whatever work (<em>dullu</em>) that is to be done inside it with bricks (<em>libnāte</em>), reeds (<em>qan&acirc;te</em>) and beams (<em>gu&scaron;ūri</em>). The renter should also deliver 0;0.2 kor (2 l.) of <em>tābīlu-</em>herbs each year. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Kināya/Lamassanni-Gula//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Gula"
