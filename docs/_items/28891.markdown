paraphrase: "The document is too fragmentary in order to determine its exact content. It seems to be related to the sale of a field. At the beginning we can see remnants of personal names, a.o. the person who owns land next to the seller (<em>maḫirānu</em>) of a field (<em>eqlu</em>), followed by a description of the field&rsquo;s location, and the remnants of a sale formula (<em>mahīru nab&ucirc;, ana &scaron;īmi</em>). At the sealing of this document were present at least 10 witnesses. Present (<em>ina a&scaron;ābi</em>) was further <sup>f</sup>Bēlilitu, wife of Arad-Ninurta-<em>mi-tu</em>. Name of the scribe is probably Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-uṣur/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi (l. 22f.). A final note points out that <em>silver</em> for going on a campaign (<em>ana alāki &scaron;a madakti</em>) &hellip;. Arad-Ninurta-<em>mi-tu</em> has been given (<em>nadnu</em>)."
