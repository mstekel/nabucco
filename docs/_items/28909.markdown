paraphrase: "Court protocol.<br /> The tablet records an accusatory deposition in court and the royal judges&#39; decision. The plaintiffs are <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and her adopted son <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>; the defendant is her husband&#39;s brother <strong>B</strong>. The case primarily concerns her rights to a house that she and her husband bought with her dowry silver.<br /> The court protocol opens with a quotation of <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>1</sub></strong>&#39;s statement before the judges of Nabonidus. She recounts that she is married to <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong>, brought 3 1/2 minas of silver as her dowry (<em>nudunn&ucirc;</em>) into the marriage, and bore him a daughter <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>D</strong>. Together they bought a built house (<em>bītu ep&scaron;u</em>), 8 reeds (c. 90 m<sup>2</sup>) large, in the district (<em>er</em><em>ṣ</em><em>etu</em>) called &ldquo;Small region on the other bank&rdquo; (<em>ahullā qalla</em>) in Borsippa, for 9 minas and 20 shekels of silver. The purchase was financed a.o. with her dowry silver and with a loan (<em>ana nishi na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) of 2 minas and 30 shekels of silver from C (cf. BM30506 = Nbn 187). In Nabonidus&rsquo; 4<sup>th</sup> regnal year, she argued with her husband (<em>itti ragāmu</em>) about (<em>a&scaron;&scaron;u</em>) her dowry and he, with full consent (<em>ina migir libbi&scaron;u</em>), gave her under seal (<em>kanāku</em> - <em>dagālu </em>&Scaron;) that built house in Borsippa, forever (<em>ana ūmī ṣ&acirc;ti</em>). In the donation document, he stated that they agreed to pay off together (<em>itti ahame&scaron; eṭēru</em>) the 2 1/2 minas of silver that they borrowed (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) from <strong>B</strong> for the purchase of that house. <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong> wrote down (<em>&scaron;a</em><em>ṭ</em><em>āru</em>) the oath that he pronounced by the great gods in the document and sealed it. In Nabonidus&rsquo; 5<sup>th</sup> regnal year, she and her husband adopted <strong>C</strong> as son (<em>ana mārūti leq&ucirc;</em>), and they wrote (<em>&scaron;aṭāru</em>) an adoption tablet (<em>ṭuppi mārūti</em>) for him. At that time they also made known (<em>id&ucirc; </em>&Scaron;) the content of their daughter&#39;s dowry (<strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>D</strong>): 2 minas and 10 shekels of silver and household goods (<em>ud&ecirc; bīti</em>). Now, after <strong>A</strong><sub>3</sub>&rsquo;s death, <strong>B</strong>, his brother (= <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>&#39;s in-law, <em>em&ucirc;</em>) has raised a claim (<em>paqāri ba&scaron;&ucirc; </em>&Scaron;) on the house and on everything else that his brother gave to <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> in a sealed document (<em>kanāku &ndash; dagālu &Scaron;</em>), as well as on a slave, <strong>E</strong>, whom the couple bought (<em>ana kaspi abāku</em>) from <strong>F</strong>. <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> concludes her statement by saying: I have brought (<em>abālu</em>) him in front of you: establish our decision (<em>puruss&ucirc; &scaron;akānu</em>)!&rdquo;.<br /> The second part of the tablet records the judges&rsquo; actions and verdict. They hear the parties&rsquo; arguments (<em>dibbu</em> <em>&scaron;em&ucirc;</em>), review (<em>&scaron;as&ucirc;</em>) the tablets (<em>ṭuppu)</em> and contracts (<em>riksu</em>) that <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> brought as evidence, and deliberate (<em>mitluku</em>). They deny <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s claims (<em>la ra&scaron;&ucirc;</em> &Scaron;) on the house in Borsippa, which had been given to <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>1</sub></strong> instead of her dowry (<em>kūm nudunn&ecirc;</em>), the slave <strong>E</strong> whom she bought (<em>ana kaspi &scaron;&acirc;mu</em>) together with her husband and everything else that belonged to <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong>. The judges establish the legal rights of&nbsp; <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> on the basis of their written evidence (<em>ina ṭuppi uzuzzu</em>). <strong>B</strong> will have priority (<em>pen&ucirc;</em>) in recovering (<em>&scaron;alāmu</em> G) the silver, 2 1/2 minas, which was used to pay for the house; then, <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>1</sub></strong> will recover&nbsp; the 3 1/2 minas of silver from her dowry; finally, <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong> will get <strong>E</strong> as her inheritance share (<em>zittu</em>), as established in her father&rsquo;s contracts (<em>riksu</em>). Names of 6 witnesses, all judges of Nabonidus, and 2 scribes: Nādin//Pahāru, and Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun//Rab-bān&ecirc;. Seal impression of the judges.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A<sub>1</sub> </strong>= <sup>f</sup>Bunanītu/Hariṣāya, wife of A<sub>3</sub>; <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = Apla-dādu-abārī, adopted son of <sup>f</sup>A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>3</sub>; <strong>A<sub>3</sub> </strong>= Apla-dād-natan/Niqmadu; <strong>B</strong> = Aqab-ili, <sup>f</sup>A<sub>1</sub>&#39;s in-law (<em>em&ucirc;</em>);<strong> C </strong>= Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Nuptāya, daughter of <sup>f</sup>A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>3</sub>; <strong>E</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-nūr-ilī; <strong>F</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin"
