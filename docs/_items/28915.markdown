paraphrase: "Sale of a slave.<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and his wife <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>2</sub></strong> sold their slave <strong>C </strong>(part of <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>2</sub></strong>&rsquo;s dowry) to <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and his wife <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong>. Now, <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> sell this same slave to <strong>D</strong>, a courtier (<em>rē&scaron; &scaron;arri</em>), for a purchase price amounting to 1/3 mina and 5 shekels of silver. Then, the text mentions <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>2</sub></strong> again, but the verb of this sentence is broken: from what follows it seems they haven&#39;t received their silver yet. At the end of the tablet it is stated that <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub> </strong>(eventually) pay them the 1/3 mina and 5 shekels of silver through the proxy <strong>E</strong>. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Etel-p&icirc;/Ṣillāya//Nubu; <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Hana&scaron;u, wife of A<sub>1</sub>; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nergal-uballiṭ/Kudurru; <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub> </strong>= <sup>f</sup>Hibtāya/Anni-&scaron;unu, wife of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>C</strong> = Silīm-Bēl; <strong>D</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ṣābit-qāti, <em>rē&scaron; &scaron;arri</em>; <strong>E</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi"
