paraphrase: "Sale of real estate and receipt of purchase price. Fragmentary.<br /> <strong>A </strong>sells part of a royal passageway(?) ([<em>bīt</em>(?)] <em>ta-ri-ku-ut-ta</em>) belonging to <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong>, located near the way out (<em>mūṣ&ucirc;</em>) of his own house, to <strong>B</strong>: the long side of the purchased passageway measures 7 1/2 cubits (c. 3,75 m), and its short side in the West is adjacent to the way out (<em>mūṣ&ucirc;</em>) of <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s house. The purchase price amounts to 15 shekels of white silver (<em>kaspu peṣ&ucirc;</em>): the seller acknowledges that he has received it in full from <strong>B</strong>. Some of the description of the side is unclear and needs further clarification. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Marduk-mukīn-apli/Ibnāya//Rab-līmu.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-nāṣir/Itti-Bēl-lummir(?)//Basia; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Nuptāya/Nādinu/Bīnāya; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Aplatu (Achemenet: Abbatu)/Nādinu//Bīnāya, sister of <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong>"
