paraphrase: "Promissory note for barley. Very fragmentary.<br /> The top part of the tablet is lost. From what is extant, one understands that <strong>A </strong>owes to <strong>B</strong>,<strong> C</strong>&rsquo;s slave, [x]+0;0.4 kor (c. 24 l) of barley. The debtor will pay the full amount according to <strong>C</strong>&#39;s measure (<em>ma&scaron;īhu</em>) in one instalment (<em>ina muhhi i&scaron;tet ritti</em>) in <strong>C</strong>&#39;s house. Delivery is due in a month whose name is lost in a lacuna. Rest broken off. Names of witnesses and scribe broken off.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= &hellip;/Rēmūt; <strong>B</strong> = Madān-bēlu-uṣur; <strong>C</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi"
