paraphrase: "Leasing of a slave or work contract: copy of a previous, fragmentary document.<br /> This fragment of a tablet consists in a copy of a previous document, which was already in poor condition in antiquity: the scribe, in fact, indicates with the usual indication <em>hepi</em> the several gaps he found in the original tablet. <strong>A</strong>, baker (<em>nuhatimmu</em>) and <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s slave,&nbsp; &lt;broken&gt; will perform (<em>epē&scaron;u</em>) the craft of the baker (<em>nuhatimmūtu</em>) with &lt;broken&gt; <strong>C</strong>, <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s slave. &lt;broken&gt;&nbsp; He will deliver (<em>nadānu</em>) every day 30 loaves of bread, from an unknown day of &Scaron;abāṭ (XI) until &lt;broken&gt;. From the end of Addar (XII) to [&hellip;] (broken off, large gap). In the final readable lines, it is stated that <strong>C</strong> will give (<em>nadānu</em>) the compensatory payment (<em>mandattu</em>) to <strong>B</strong>. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Bēl-kāṣir/Rehētu/Isināya.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = broken name, baker and slave of <strong>B</strong>; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>C</strong> = ...-ṣābit-qātia, slave of <strong>D</strong>; <strong>D</strong> = Iqī&scaron;a-Marduk/Dābibi"
