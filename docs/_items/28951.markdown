The first measured area (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>) consists of 1;1.5.3.8 kor (18735 m<sup>2</sup>) of arable land (<em>zēru</em>) including 4 gar (30 m<sup>2</sup>) of a triangular shaped plot and the land between the fields (<em>adi birat</em>). The upper long side in the West measures 988 1/3 cubits (c. 494,1 m), is adjacent to the 4 gar (30 m<sup>2</sup>) of triangular shaped land that is an integral part of the measured area (<em>santakki libbi eqli</em>), and borders on (the properties of) <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>; the lower long side in the East is 1006 5/6 cubits (c. 503,4 m) long and borders on the share taken (<em>ṣabātu</em>) by <strong>A</strong>. The upper front in the North measures 76 1/6 cubits (c. 38,08 m), includes 2 1/2 cubits (1,25 m), the short side of the triangular shaped land (<em>pūt santakki</em>), and is adjacent to the bank (<em>ki&scaron;ādu</em>) of the New Canal; the lower front in the South is adjacent to the next portion of land.<br /> The second measured area (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>) consists of 3;3.3.4.7 kor (50302,5 m<sup>2</sup>) of arable land (<em>zēru</em>), including <em>a&scaron;kuttu-</em>land. Its upper long side in the West is 2643 cubits (1321,5 m) long and borders on (the property of) <strong>D</strong>, the oblate (<em>&scaron;irku</em>) of Marduk, the lower side in the East measures 2646 cubits (1323 m) and borders on (the property of) <strong>A</strong>.

Its upper long side in the West is 858 cubits (4279 m) long and borders on (the property of) <strong>D</strong>, the oblate (<em>&scaron;irku</em>) of Marduk, the lower side in the East measures 855 cubits (427,5 m) and borders on (the property of) <strong>A</strong>.
