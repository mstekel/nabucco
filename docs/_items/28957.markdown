paraphrase: "Hiring of a slave. To do repair work<br /> <strong>A</strong><em> leases</em> his slave <strong>C</strong> who is a leatherworker to <strong>B</strong> for 3&frac14; shekels of silver. He has to do repair work on the house and in return he will receive clothing (<em>muṣiptu</em>) from B. The latter also has to provide for the<em> kīnayātu-</em>gifts for the Enlil(-ceremony) in Nisan as an additional payment (<em>nuptu</em>). During one year (<em>adi ṭuppi ṭuppi</em>) will the slave <em>be at his disposal</em>(?). Names of xxx witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= Iddin-Bēl/Silim-Bēl//&hellip;; <strong>C </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-<em>ku-&uacute;</em>..., slave."
