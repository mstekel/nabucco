paraphrase: "Receipt of payment; purchase of residential estate.<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and his mother <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>2</sub></strong> sell their built-on plot (<em>bīt ep&scaron;u</em>) located at the Nab&ucirc; Gate in &Scaron;ahrīnu, measuring 9 sq. r (c. 110,25 m<sup>2</sup>), to <strong>B</strong>. Details for the localization of this plot are provided: its upper long side in the East borders on <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s (the buyer&rsquo;s) house, the upper front in the North is adjacent to the wide street (<em>sūqu rap&scaron;u</em>) and the lower front in the South borders on <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s house. In a fragmentary passage, the purchase price is calculated at a ratio of 2/3 minas and 8 shekels per each sq. r (12,25 m<sup>2</sup>) of land and accordingly fixed at 7 minas and 15 shekels of silver. To this a supplementary payment (<em>atru</em>) of [9?] shekels of silver is added. <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and his mother <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>2</sub></strong> acknowledge that they have received in total 7 1/3 minas and 4 shekels (i.e. 7 minas and 24 shekels) of silver from <strong>B</strong>, as a consequence of the sale of their plot (<em>bītu</em>). The area will be measured: should it be found larger or smaller than what was originally calculated, they will compensate each other according to the field-price ratio they agreed upon. Names of 9 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-bēlu-kalamu/Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir-nap&scaron;āti//La-kubburu; <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>2 </sub></strong>= <sup>f</sup>Inbāya/Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-apli//&Scaron;ig&ucirc;a, mother of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-zēri/Ina-tē&scaron;&ecirc;-ēṭir//&Scaron;ama&scaron;-abārī"
