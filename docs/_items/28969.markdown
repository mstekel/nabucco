paraphrase: "Agreement about repair-works at a house.<br /> The tablet is related to a wall (<em>igāru</em>) of a house that is located in front of the Gi&scaron;&scaron;u Gate and belongs to <strong>A </strong>and his brothers. <strong>B</strong> has fixed (<em>ṣabātu</em>) its beams (<em>gu&scaron;ūru</em>): now, he will have to remove (<em>dek&ucirc;</em>) the beams from <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s wall. He should also fill up (<em>mal&ucirc; </em>D) the city&#39;s earthen ramp (<em>kamru</em>) which he had breached (<em>abāku </em>Gt) and give it to <strong>A</strong>. The wall belongs (exclusively) to <strong>A</strong>: <strong>B</strong> has no (claim to its) drainpipes (<em>naṣṣabu, </em>wr.<em> x</em>(NIN)<em>-&gt;ṣa-bi</em>) (and) beams (or: the <em>za-bi</em> (uncl., perhaps &quot;compensation(?)&quot;) of the beams). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Zababa-iddin/Bēl-iddin//Adad-&scaron;am&ecirc;"
