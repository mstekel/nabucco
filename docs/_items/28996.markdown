paraphrase: "Fragmentary. Cannot be classified.<br /> The tablet is too damaged to reconstruct its content. It belongs to the Egibi/Nūr-S&icirc;n archive because Iddin-[Marduk/Iqi&scaron;āya]//Nūr-S&icirc;n is mentioned. Legible is the word <em>anāku</em>, which may refer to oath taking and the verb <em>inamdin</em> which suggest an undertaking to pay. Apart from the first witness, the names of the witnesses and the scribe are broken.&nbsp; &nbsp;"
