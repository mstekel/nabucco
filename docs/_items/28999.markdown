paraphrase: "Receipt for the purchase price of land. Dissolution of a business partnership.<br /> <strong>A</strong> sold arable land (<em>zēru</em>) situated along the old Kutha Channel to <strong>B</strong> and acknowledges his receipt (<em>eṭēru</em>) of the corresponding price (the exact amount that is paid is not specified). With this transaction, they agree that all accounts have been settled and consider their former business partnership (<em>harrānu</em>) closed. It is further pointed out that the seller has returned the promissory note (<em>u&lsquo;iltu</em>) for payment of the remaining price of the land (<em>t&acirc;ru</em> D &ndash; <em>nadānu</em>); and that the buyer gave on his own initiative (<em>ina migir libbī&scaron;u</em>) 6 shekels of silver as a gift (<em>qī&scaron;tu</em>) to the seller. The parties to the contract have taken one&nbsp; copy of the document each. Names of 10 witnesses and the scribe. The promissory note mentioned in this text must be BM30898 (= Dar 61)<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bel-ēṭir/Mu&scaron;ēb&scaron;i//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi."
