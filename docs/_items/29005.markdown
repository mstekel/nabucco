paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases 1;1.4 kor (18000 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>), a grain field (<em>p&icirc; &scaron;ulpu</em>) in &Scaron;uppatu, from <strong>B</strong>: part of it, 1 Kor (13500 m<sup>2</sup>), is cultivated land (<em>mēre&scaron;u</em>) and the remaining 0;1.4 Kor (4500 m<sup>2</sup>) is land of bad soil quality (<em>kal&ucirc; u gabību</em>). This field is the share (<em>zitti</em>) of <strong>B</strong>, who owns it together with his brothers <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> and his uncle <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong>; the description of the plot of land is minimal, only the boundaries for its upper and lower sides are given, i.e.&nbsp; <strong>D</strong>&rsquo; and <strong>E</strong>&rsquo;s properties, but we do not know if they refer to the long side or the front.<br /> <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent for this field together with the seller <strong>B</strong> (<em>itti</em> B A <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>), who acknowledges that he has received (<em>mahāru</em>) an amount of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>) which is lost in a lacuna, and is (<em>apālu </em>&nbsp;G Stat). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Kidin-Marduk/Zēria//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Gula; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-zēri//As&ucirc;; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-uballiṭ; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nergal-zēru-ibni; <strong>C<sub>3</sub> </strong>= Mukīn-Marduk; <strong>D</strong> = Marduk-&scaron;umu-ibni/&hellip;//Basia; <strong>E</strong> = Tabnēa/Ina-tē&scaron;&ecirc;-ēṭir//As&ucirc;"
