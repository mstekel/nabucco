paraphrase: "House rental. Very fragmentary.<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>3</sub></strong> rent <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>&rsquo;s house, which is near <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s house, to <strong>B </strong>for 2 years, at a yearly rent amounting to 12 shekels of silver. The text is very damaged, only a few words can be recognised: they must have referred to the agreement of paying half of the silver at the beginning of the year, and the remainder in the middle. Then, the renter&rsquo;s obligations were mentioned. The house is at the renter&rsquo;s disposal starting from Simān (III) onwards. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēre&scaron;/Bēl-ile&rsquo;&rsquo;i//Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;; <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Bānītu-ēṭirat/Marduk-&scaron;umu-uṣur//Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;; <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>3</sub> </strong>= <sup>f</sup>Andi-Nanāya/Marduk-&scaron;umu-uṣur//Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = <sup>f</sup>S&icirc;n-bannāya; <strong>D</strong> = &Scaron;umu-iddin/&hellip;"
