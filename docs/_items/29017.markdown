paraphrase: "Receipt for silver. Final payment of a debt. Return of all promissory notes to the debtor(s).<br /> Concerns the old debt (<em>u&#39;iltu arkītu</em>) for 3 minas of silver that <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> owed to <strong>A</strong> and for which a promissory note had been issued (<em>e&rsquo;ēlu</em>). <strong>A</strong> received payment (<em>eṭēru</em>) for this debt, so that there are no more claims (<em>ra&scaron;ūtu</em>) by <strong>A</strong> against either <strong>B<sub>1</sub> </strong>or his father <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, be it for silver, barley,&nbsp; dates or anything else. Whatever promissory note that may still exist (<em>mala ba&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) against them, should it turn up (<em>el&ucirc;</em>) in the creditor&#39;s house, it shall belong to the <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>. Names of 4 witnesses (3 listed before the date, and one after it), and the scribe.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong>=Nab&ucirc;-neb-ana-ilī/Bābu-iddin//Arrabtu; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = &Scaron;ulāya/Nab&ucirc;-zēru-ukīn//Egibi, father of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>"
