In their presence (<em>ina pāni</em>) <strong>A</strong>, slave (<em>qallu</em>) of <strong>C</strong>, declared that <strong>B</strong> beat him up (<em>ṭēru</em>) in the afternoon (<em>muṣlalu</em>) of the 6<sup>th</sup> day of Ta&scaron;rīt (VII) in an unlawful way (<em>&scaron;igiltu</em>), pierced (<em>&scaron;aqāru </em>D) his <em>ṣibtu</em>-garment with the sharp side of his door-key (<em>sikkat namzaq bābi,</em> wr. <sup>gi&scaron;</sup>NĺG.GAG k&aacute;) saying as follows: &quot;This is the word (<em>amātu</em>) of the king: a slave doesn&rsquo;t put on (<em>nad&ucirc;</em>) a loin cloth (<em>qablu ṣubātu</em>) of first quality (<em>rē&scaron;tu</em>) wool (<em>&scaron;ipātu</em>) around his waist (<em>qablu).</em>&quot; The document is dated but there is no list of witnesses (<em>mukinnu</em>). The scribe is Nidinti-Bēl/Iddināya//Sagilāya.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Madān-bēlu-uṣur; <strong>B </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir/Nergal-&scaron;umu-ibni//Ēṭiru; <strong>C </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi"
