paraphrase: "Allocation of an inheritance share. Very fragmentary.<br /> <strong>A </strong><em>receives</em>(?) (The verb is lost in a lacuna) one slave, <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong>, together with 1/2 mina of silver instead of his fourth-share in the inheritance <em>from </em><strong>B</strong>, his elder brother. The slave is one out of a group of six, mentioned in the opening lines: <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and his wife <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong>, together with their son <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong> and still nursing (<em>&scaron;a &scaron;izib</em>) daughter <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>4</sub></strong>, <strong>C<sub>5</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>6</sub></strong>: in total 6 slaves (<em>amīlūtu</em>). Rest broken off. Names of 4+ witnesses and the scribe: Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu/Marduk-&scaron;umu-uṣur//Nappāhu. At the end of the tablet it is pointed out that the text has been written in order to avoid that changes (to the inheritance division) be made (<em>ana lā en&ecirc;</em>), and that the parties have taken one copy of the document each.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nergal-ēṭir/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> =&nbsp; Uqūpu; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Silim-I&scaron;tar, wife of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong> = Bēl-pitnanni, son of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong>; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>4</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ninlil-rē&rsquo;&ucirc;a, daughter of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong>; <strong>C<sub>5</sub></strong> = Ina-qāt-Bēl-&scaron;akin; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>6</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Latuba&scaron;inni"
