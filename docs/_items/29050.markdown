paraphrase: "Court protocol.<br /> The tablet is related to <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>, the slave of <strong>A</strong> who bought (<em>ana kaspi mahāru</em>) him from <strong>D</strong>, however <strong>B</strong> claims that the slave&rsquo;s real name is <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> and that he is his slave (<em>qallu</em>), (but) he disappeared (<em>halāqu</em>)&quot;. <strong>B </strong>even swore by the gods: &quot;I really don&rsquo;t know where he is, he is not with me (<em>ina pānī dagālu</em>)!&quot;. Should <strong>B</strong> know where (the slave) is staying (lit. &ldquo;where he sees him&rdquo;), then he should bring him along (<em>abāku</em>) and their case will be discussed (<em>puruss&ucirc; &scaron;akānu</em>) in front of the chief judge (<em>sartennu</em>) and the judges (<em>dayyānu</em>). Should this slave be found in <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s house, he will work for 10 days for <strong>B</strong> as compensation for the time he was absent (<em>mandattu</em>). He will make up for the loss (<em>&scaron;alāmu </em>D) according to the royal &ldquo;law&rdquo; (<em>ak&icirc; dātu &scaron;a &scaron;arri</em>). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-aplu-iddin/ Nabunadinahi/ MudammiqMarduk; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;epe-&scaron;u-&scaron;usbat, slave of A; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-killanni (real name of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>); <strong>D</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-uballiṭ/Nab&ucirc;-aplu-iddin//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu"
