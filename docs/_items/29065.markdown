paraphrase: "Undertaking to warrant for sold slaves.<br /> <strong>A </strong>took away <strong>C</strong>, slave of <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong>, from <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong> (<em>ina qātē abāku</em>), for silver (<em>ana kaspi</em>), i.e. because of her silver debt to him. He then sold the slave to <strong>B</strong> (<em>ana kaspi nadānu</em>). The purchase price, whose amount is not explicitly mentioned, was paid with silver of which one-sixth is alloy. <strong>A</strong> guarantees against (suits brought by) a person acting unlawfully (<em>sēh&ucirc;</em>) or a person raising claims (<em>pāqirānu</em>). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir-nap&scaron;āti/Nab&ucirc;-apla-uṣur.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir-nap&scaron;āti/Nab&ucirc;-nā&#39;id/Mandid; <strong>B</strong> = Kāṣir/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>C</strong> = Itti-Nab&ucirc;-īnia, slave of <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong>; <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong>= <sup>f</sup>Guzummu."
