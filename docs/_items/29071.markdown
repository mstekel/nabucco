paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> The tablet records the purchase of agricultural land; the text has been divided into paragraphs, marked on the tablet by a line drawn at the end of each one (and indicated below in the paraphrase by LINE).<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases land from <strong>B</strong>; many details about the field are lost since the top part of the tablet is damaged, only some of the bordering properties are extant. Its upper side in the West borders on two fields, but only one of the owners&rsquo; name (<strong>C</strong>) can still be read, and its lower side in the East borders on <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s land; the upper front in the North is adjacent to the royal domain (<em>pīhat &scaron;arri</em>) and its lower front in the South borders on the dam of the&nbsp;<em>han&scaron;u</em>s (<em>makall&ucirc; &scaron;a han&scaron;ānē</em>). LINE<br /> <strong>A</strong> has declared the equivalent for this land, 23;2.3 Kor (31725 m<sup>2</sup>) in total, together with the seller <strong>B</strong> (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>): 1 shekel of silver for each 6 gar (45 m<sup>2</sup>) of date garden (<em>gi&scaron;immarē zaqpu</em>) and 1 shekel of silver for each 45 gar (337,5 m<sup>2</sup>) of cultivated as well as newly cleared land (<em>mēre&scaron;u u tapt&ucirc;</em>). <strong>A</strong> has given (<em>nadānu</em>) 19 minas and 8 shekels of silver as total price (<em>&scaron;īmi&scaron;u gamrūtu</em>) of this field, plus 22 shekels of silver as additional payment (<em>k&icirc; atri</em>). LINE<br /> <strong>B</strong> acknowledges that he has received (<em>mahāru</em>) in total 19 minas and 30 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), and he is satisfied (<em>apālu </em>&nbsp;G Stat). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. One final clause establishes that the field will be measured (<em>ma&scaron;āhu</em>) and (should its area be found smaller or larger than what they had calculated) they will compensate each other (<em>ahāmi&scaron; apālu</em>) according to the field-price ratio (<em>mahīru</em>) they agreed upon. Names of 4+ witnesses and 2 scribes. The numbers related to the fields width are given here following Wunsch&rsquo;s calculations (Wunsch 2000, 8).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Aplāya/Iqī&scaron;a-Marduk//S&icirc;n-nādin-&scaron;umi; <strong>B</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-unammir//Basia; <strong>C</strong> = Mu&scaron;allim-Marduk/&hellip;; <strong>D</strong> = Iqī&scaron;a-Marduk"
