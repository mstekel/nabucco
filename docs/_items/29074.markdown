Its upper side in the West borders on (the property of) <strong>A</strong>, the buyer, the lower side in the East on (the property f) <strong>C</strong>; the upper front in the North is adjacent to the bank (<em>ki&scaron;ādu</em>) of the Bitqu-&scaron;a-Ile&rsquo;&rsquo;i-Bēl and the lower front in the South borders on (the property of) <strong>D</strong>. <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent for this land of 0;0.4.1.9 Kor (1942,5 m<sup>2</sup>) together with the sellers <strong>B<sub>1</sub> </strong>and his mother <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>) to be 40 shekels of silver as total purchase price (<em>&scaron;īmi&scaron;u gamrūtu</em>) plus 2 shekels of silver as additional payment (<em>k&icirc; atri</em>). <strong>B<sub>1</sub> </strong>and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> acknowledge that they have received (<em>mahāru</em>) 42 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), and they are satisfied (<em>aplū</em>). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. The field will be measured: should it be found larger or smaller than what was originally calculated, they will compensate each other (<em>ahāmi&scaron; apālu </em>) according to the field-price ratio (<em>mahīru</em>) they agreed upon. Fingernails impressions (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the sellers, <strong>B<sub>1</sub> </strong>and his mother <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, instead of their seal impressions (<em>kunukku</em>).
