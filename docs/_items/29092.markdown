paraphrase: "Appropriation of land instead of dowry-silver from the paternal estate. Promissory note for the remaining dowry-silver.<br /> Concerns 24 minas of silver that belong to <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>&#39;s dowry and that her husband&rsquo;s father (<strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>) received (<em>mahāru</em>) from her father (<strong>B</strong>) (cf. Wunsch 1993, no. 109). Apparently, <strong>A<sub>1</sub> </strong>had invested the silver in his own business, so that even years later, after his death, his son, <strong>A<sub>1 </sub></strong>takes possession (<em>leq&ucirc;</em>) of the (i.e. his family&rsquo;s) arable land at the Zabunu- and Hazuzu-ditches, property (<em>bītu)</em> that had been received (by the family) (<em>mahāru</em>) from <strong>D</strong>. The land has thus become part of&nbsp; his wife&rsquo;s dowry instead (<em>kī</em>) of part of the original 24 minas of dowry-silver. By appropriating it, <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> acted in accordance with what had been agreed between him and his brothers (<em>aki ṭuppi&scaron;unu</em>, lit. &ldquo;according to their tablets&rdquo;). The remaining (dowry-)silver (<em>rīhtu</em>) will be paid from that part of the paternal estate that remains undivided (<em>kar&ucirc; bīt abi</em>). On <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>&rsquo;s dowry, see also BM33114 (= Wunsch 1993, no. 137). Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi;<strong> A<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi, father of A<sub>1</sub>; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Marduk(//Nūr-S&icirc;n); <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Nuptāya/Iddin-Marduk//Nūr-S&icirc;n, wife of A<sub>1</sub>; <strong>D</strong> = Tabnēa (without affiliation); <strong>E</strong>= Iddin-Nab&ucirc;, brother of A<sub>1</sub>; <strong>F</strong> = Nergal-ēṭir, brother of A<sub>1</sub>"
