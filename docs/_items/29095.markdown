paraphrase: "About a business partnership<sup>?</sup> (<em>harranu</em>). Very fragmentary.<br /> The document is in such a bad state of preservation that the type of transaction recorded in it cannot be determined. It seems to be related to a business partnership. Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi, head of the Egibi family is among the protagonists. Names of at least 5 witnesses and the scribe: Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu/Marduk-&scaron;umu-uṣur<em>//Napp</em><em>ā</em><em>hu</em>. At the very end of the document a short remark mentions dates of Kalbāya which B&ecirc;l-sūp&ecirc;-muhur brought.&nbsp;"
