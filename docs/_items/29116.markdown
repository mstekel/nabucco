They will leave the next day (on the 15<sup>th</sup> of Ayyar (II)). He should [give} each day x+1200 onion strings as (his) labour obligation (<em>i&scaron;karu). </em>The onions &hellip; (at this point the tablet breaks off). Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Nab&ucirc;-aplu-iddin/<em>Nab&ucirc;</em>-mu&scaron;ētiq-udd&ecirc;//Damqa.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Marduk-nāṣir; <strong>B</strong> = Ṣilli-Bēl, slave of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>C</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n<br /> &nbsp;"
