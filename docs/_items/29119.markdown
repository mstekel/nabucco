paraphrase: "Security for a silver debt.<br /> <strong>B</strong><sub>1</sub> (still) owes 2 minas and 14 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>, for which, among others, <strong>C</strong>&#39;s house is given as (after-)pledge (cf. BM30350 = Nbk. 133). Out of the said amount of silver, 1 mina and 54 &frac12; shekels are (now) owed by <strong>B<sub>2</sub> </strong>his son (lit. are at <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>&rsquo;s disposal, <em>ina pāni</em>) and for the remaining amount (<em>rēhu</em>) the son will pay 2 shekels on a monthly basis in the form of (<em>kima</em>) house rent to <strong>A</strong> from the 1<sup>st</sup> of Abu (V) onwards. At the end of the document, after the list of witnesses and the date, and written on the tablet&#39;s upper edge, the issue of pledge and house rent is taken up in more detail, but part of the phraseology remains obscure. It is said that the previous house rent due from (<em>ina pāni</em>) <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and the house rent due from<strong> B<sub>2</sub></strong> to [&hellip;]<strong> A</strong> (uncl.); <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong> and whatever <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> (lit. &quot;he&quot;) owns in and outside of the city are pledged to <strong>A</strong>. On the same matter, see also its final settlement in BM30348 = Nbk. 172 (2 &frac12; years after the current document). Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nergal-uballiṭ/I&scaron;um-uballiṭ//Bēl-ēṭiru; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = &Scaron;ulāya/Nab&ucirc;-zēru-ukīn//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>C</strong>= (Marduk-)&Scaron;āpik-zēri/Marduk-zēru-ibni//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Ninurta; <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ina-ṣilli-Bēl"
