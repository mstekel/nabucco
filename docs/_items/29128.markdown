paraphrase: "Receipt for silver. Purchase price for land.<br /> <strong>B </strong>receives <em>(ittenṭir</em>, [<em>eṭēru</em> N]) 26 shekels of white silver from <strong>A</strong> as has been agreed upon (<em>aki ṭuppi</em>). It is the price for land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>) and a plot of land of bad soil quality (<em>kal&ucirc; u gabību</em>) in &Scaron;aḫrīnu which he sold to <strong>A</strong> on the 5<sup>th</sup> of Adar (XII) of the previous year (Darius 22). Should the original document or any duplicate of it be found in the seller&rsquo;s house, this will belong to the buyer. Names of 7 witnesses and scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-uballiṭ/Lūṣi-ana-nūri//Andahar"
