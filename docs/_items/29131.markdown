paraphrase: "Purchase of land;<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases a plot of land from <strong>B</strong>, who shares the property of it with his uncle <strong>C</strong>. The opening lines, which contained information on the surface area together with its typology and adjacent properties, are lost &ndash; except for the mentioning of one neighbour, <strong>D</strong>, and the indication that it is a measured field (<em>zēru mi&scaron;ihti</em>). Also the rest of the text is poorly preserved. From what can still be read one infers that the seller acknowledges that he has received the full amount of silver corresponding to the purchase price (<em>&scaron;īmi&scaron;u gamrūtu</em>). Names of witnesses and scribe lost. The same purchase is recorded (with more details) in the tablet O637.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nergal-zēru-ibni/Nergal-uballiṭ//Sagdidi; <strong>C</strong> = Taqī&scaron;-Gula, uncle of <strong>B</strong>; <strong>D</strong> = Kabtia/Nādin//Suhāya"
