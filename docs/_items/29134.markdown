The upper side in the North, 1320 cubits (660 m) long, borders on <strong>C</strong>, its lower long side in the South which has the same length borders on <strong>D</strong>. The upper front in the West, 53 1/2 cubits (26,75 m) long, borders on the bank of the Euphrates (<em>ki&scaron;ād Puratti</em>) and the lower front in the East borders on (the property of) <strong>A</strong>, the buyer. The total measure (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>) of this field is 1;0.3.2 Kor (15000 m<sup>2</sup>), including the share (<em>zittu</em>) of <strong>B</strong>, amounting to 0;1.2.1.5 1/2 Kor (3716,5 m<sup>2</sup>) including 0;0.1 Kor (450 m<sup>2</sup>) of land between the fields (<em>birat</em>), which he had not yet divided (<em>zu&rsquo;uzu</em>) with <strong>A</strong>. LINE<br /> <strong>A</strong> has declared the equivalent for this land together with the seller <strong>B</strong> (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc;</em>): the land is valued 1 shekel per 1 SIL&Agrave; 1 1/4 gar (84,3 m<sup>2</sup>) &ndash; 38 2/3 shekels in total &ndash; and the land between the fields (<em>birat</em>) is valued 1 shekel per 4 1/2 SIL&Agrave; (337,5 m<sup>2</sup>) &ndash; 1 1/3 shekels in total. <strong>A</strong> has paid 40 shekels of silver, plus 1 shekel as additional payment (<em>a</em><em>ki atri</em>).
