The present document points out that 1 mina of this silver is what <strong>C</strong> invested in a business partnership with <strong>A</strong> (<em>&scaron;a harrāni &scaron;a ~</em>). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Bēl-u&scaron;allim/Zēria//Nabāya.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Marduk-ēṭir//Nappāhu; <strong>C</strong> = &Scaron;iriktu(/Nūrea//Dannea)"
