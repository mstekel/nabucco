paraphrase: "House rental.<br /> <strong>A</strong> rents a house located in front of (<em>ina pani</em>) the Gi&scaron;&scaron;u-Gate to <strong>B</strong>, for a yearly rental price amounting to 1/3 mina and 3 shekels of silver. The renter should repair the wall foundations (<em>asurr&ucirc;</em>) and caulk (<em>&scaron;an&ucirc;</em>) the roof. He should also pay for the additional payment (<em>nūptu</em>) in Nisan (I), D&ucirc;zu (IV) and Kislim (IX). It is agreed that half of the silver should be paid at the beginning of the year, and the remainder in the middle; the landlord has (already) received 5 shekels of silver as payment for the rent. The house is at the renter&rsquo;s disposal from the 1<sup>st</sup> of Ulūl (VI) onwards. The costs for building doors (<em>daltu zaqāpu</em>) inside the house can be credited to <strong>A</strong>&#39;s account. This arrangement comes in addition (<em>elat</em>) to the one concerning&nbsp; 7 1/4 shekels of silver that are at<strong> C</strong>&#39;s disposal (<em>ina pani</em>). Name of 1 witness and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Gimillu/&Scaron;āpik-zēri//Bā&#39;iru; <strong>C</strong> = &Scaron;umu-ukīn"
