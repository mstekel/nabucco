paraphrase: "Interim settlement of accounts within the framework of a business partnership (<em>harranu</em>)<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> Concerns 50 shekels in cash (<em>hāṭu</em>), 15;0.0.0 kor of dates valued at (<em>ana kaspi man&ucirc;</em>) 15 shekels of silver, 30 beer barrels valued at 45 shekels of silver, 20 shekels of silver that are due from <strong>C</strong>, 15 shekels of silver that are at <strong>D</strong>&#39;s disposal, and 5 shekels of silver that are at <strong>E</strong>&#39;s disposal. This total amount of 2 minas and 30 shekels of silver belong to the business partnership of <strong>A </strong>and <strong>B.</strong> The part of the silver that is overdue (<em>ina ṣēri nemerk&ucirc;</em>) <strong>B</strong> should pay back to the business (<em>ana harrāni nasāku</em>) from his own assets (<em>ultu ramāni</em>), or in other words: not from the profits that he made with it. He is entitled to take (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) whatever exceeds this (<em>utru</em>). This arrangement does pertain (<em>elat</em>) to a broken amount of silver that is at <strong>E</strong>&#39;s disposal.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Kalbāya/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-apla-iddin/Ma&scaron;tuk; <strong>D</strong> = Iqī&scaron;āya/Ṣillāya; <strong>E</strong> = Sūqāya/Zababa-zēra-iqī&scaron;a"
