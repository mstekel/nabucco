paraphrase: "Warranty for a donkey within the framework of a sale.<br /> Concerns a six-year old black donkey whose ear from the cheek upwards is split (<em>batqu</em>), which <strong>A</strong> sold (<em>ana kaspi nadānu</em>) to <strong>B</strong> for its full price (<em>gamru</em>), 2/3 minas (or perhaps 5/6) of white medium-quality silver of which 1/8 is alloy. The seller assumes warranty against the status of holder of prior claims (<em>u&scaron;k&ucirc;tu</em>) for this donkey and acknowledges that he received (<em>mahāru</em>) full payment for the animal from the buyer and he is paid off (<em>eṭēru</em>). Names of 6 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Bunene-ibni; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi"
