paraphrase: "Settlement of a law suit about client people<br /> Concerns the law suit (<em>dīnu</em>), which<strong> A<sub>2</sub></strong> and his mother (<strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>2</sub></strong>) raised (<em>ragāmu</em>) against <strong>B</strong> about <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong>, her children and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>, clients in his (B&#39;s) house (<em>nī&scaron;ū bīti</em>)<em>. </em><strong>B</strong> feared (<em>adāru</em>) the litigation and did not show up (<em>alāku</em>) in court. Instead, he promptly returned some of the contested clients, namely <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and her children, to the litigants. He took an oath and for (<em>kum</em>) the third client (<strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>) who passed away while in <strong>B</strong>&#39;s house, he paid 4 minas of silver to the litigants. He made the final settlement (<em>amirtu epē&scaron;u</em>) with the litigants. Any claims (<em>dibbu</em>) concerning reeds, slaves and the slave-wages (<em>mandattu</em>) has thus been settled (<em>qat&ucirc;</em>) amongst the parties who shall not raise a new law suit against each other (<em>ana muhhi ahame&scaron; ragāmu</em>). The defendant and the litigants have sworn by Bēl and Nab&ucirc; and the majesty (<em>ad&ucirc;</em>) of Darius that they shall not reconsider (<em>nahāsu</em>) the matter that they negotiated (<em>epē&scaron;u</em>) (wording of the oath in direct speech). The document ends by stating that <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and his mother received payment (<em>eṭēru</em>) for the slave-wages. Names of 12 witnesses, a.o. Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; an Imbukean, and a Rimean; and the scribe: Nab&ucirc;-aplu-iddin/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Nin-Eanna.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Karēa/ Bēl-ile&rsquo;&rsquo;i/Ahūtu; <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>2 </sub></strong>= <sup>f</sup>Nuptāya/Nab&ucirc;-balāssu-iqbi; <strong>B </strong>= Nergal-ahu-iddin/Ahhēa;&nbsp; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1 </sub></strong>= <sup>f</sup>Kuzbāya, slave; <strong>C<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Bēl-uṣur&scaron;u (T.
