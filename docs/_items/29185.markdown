paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver, within the framework of a business partnership (<em>harrānu</em>). Pledge of slaves and general pledge.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 2 minas 7 &frac12; shekels of medium quality silver, of which one-fifth is alloy (<em>hummu&scaron;u</em>) and 50 shekels of low quality silver, of which one-twelfth to <strong>A</strong> (<em>girrētu</em>). It is an interest-free loan (<em>hubbutatu</em>). The payment is secured by the pledge of the debtor&rsquo;s property in and outside the city, as well as a family of slaves (<strong>D</strong>, his wife and children). No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged property until <strong>A</strong> has received the full repayment of his debt. The debtor swears by Bēl and Nab&ucirc; that he will pay before &Scaron;abāṭ (XI) has passed (<em>etēqu</em>). The (indebted) silver is what <strong>C</strong> invested in the business partnership with&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>&nbsp;(and which the latter now borrows to&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>). The debt is mentioned again in a document that was drafted a week later (BM30634). A year later the pledged slaves are sold to&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>&#39;s wife, cf. BM41396 (=Nbk. 34, reedited Wunsch 1993, 16). Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu/Nergal-uballiṭ//Sagilāya.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B </strong>= Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Marduk-ēṭir//Nappāhu; <strong>C </strong>= &Scaron;iriktu(/Nūrea//Dannea); <strong>D </strong>= Bēl-eṭranni (slave of <strong>B</strong>?)"
