paraphrase: "Fixation of interest on a silver debt.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 3 &frac12; minas of silver to <strong>A</strong>, on which he should pay a yearly interest of 20% on a monthly basis. The debtor is explicitly identified as brother of <strong>C</strong>. De facto, this concerns a debt between uncle (debtor) and nephew (creditor).&nbsp; In addition, there is an earlier document about the issue of warranty. Names of xxx witnesses and the scribe<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-kē&scaron;ir/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi, brother of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi"
