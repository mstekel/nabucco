paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> The tablet records the purchase of agricultural land; the text has been divided into paragraphs, marked on the tablet by a line drawn at the end of each one (and indicated below in the paraphrase by LINE).<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> purchases 0;0.5 Kor (2250 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>) from <strong>B</strong>. This is a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) bearing fruit (<em>iṣṣi bilti</em>). It is the seller&rsquo;s share (<em>zittu</em>) in land that he did not divide (<em>zu&rsquo;uzu</em>) with his older brother <strong>C</strong>, his younger brother <strong>D</strong>, and his uncle <strong>E</strong>, and is located in &Scaron;uppatu in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon. LINE<br /> Its upper side in the North borders on (the propery of) <strong>F<sub>1</sub></strong> und <strong>F<sub>2</sub></strong>, its lower side in the South on (the property of) <strong>G</strong>; its upper front in the West borders on the bank of the Euphrates (<em>ki&scaron;ād nār Puratti</em>) and its lower front in the East on (the property of) <strong>H</strong>.<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent for this land together with the seller <strong>B</strong> (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>) to be 1 shekel of silver for each 1 1/2 SIL&Agrave; (112,5 m<sup>2</sup>). The buyer gives (<em>nadānu</em>) the total purchase price (<em>&scaron;īmi&scaron;u gamrūtu</em>) of 20 shekels of silver, plus 2 shekels as additional payment (<em>k&icirc; atri</em>). <strong>B </strong>acknowledges that he has received (<em>mahāru</em>) in total 22 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), and he is satisfied. The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. A very damaged line mentions equal shares; the context however is unclear. Then the text continues establishing that the field will be measured, and should it be found larger or smaller than what was originally calculated they will compensate each other (<em>ahāmi&scaron; apālu</em>) according to the field-price ratio (<em>mahīru</em>) they agreed upon. <strong>B</strong> has also received (<em>eṭēru</em>) from <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> an amount of silver (not written in this tablet) which was due to him for the price of the harvest (<em>&scaron;īm ebūri</em>) in Cyrus&rsquo; x<sup>th</sup> year from a small plot of land (3+2 B&Aacute;N = 0.0.5+ kor or c. 2250 m<sup>2</sup>). <strong>C</strong>, his older brother, has taken (<em>leq&ucirc;</em>) a broken amount of silver (x shekels) as gift (<em>qī&scaron;tu</em>). Fingernail impressions (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller <strong>B</strong>, instead of his seal impression (<em>kunukku</em>). Names of 6 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Bu&rsquo;ītu/Nab&ucirc;-bān-ahi//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Gula; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-uballiṭ/Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-zēri//As&ucirc;; C = Iddin-Marduk/Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-zēri//As&ucirc;; <strong>D </strong>= Nergal-zēru-ibni/Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-zēri//As&ucirc;; <strong>E</strong> = Mukīn-Marduk, uncle of <strong>B</strong>; <strong>F<sub>1</sub></strong> = Zēria; <strong>F<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nā&#39;id-Marduk; <strong>G</strong> = Tabnēa/Ina-tē&scaron;&ecirc;-ēṭir//As&ucirc;; <strong>H</strong> = Kidinnu/Zēria//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Gula"
