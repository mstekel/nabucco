paraphrase: "Purchase of land<br /> The tablet records the purchase of agricultural land; the text has been divided into paragraphs, marked on the tablet by a line drawn at the end of each one (and indicated below in the paraphrase by LINE).<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases 0;1.5.4 Kor (5250 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) located in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>) from <strong>B</strong>. It consists of cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) bearing fruit (<em>iṣṣi bilti</em>), land cultivated with big as well as young date palms (<em>tālāni</em>), located in front of the Zababa Gate in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon. LINE<br /> The upper long side in the North borders on (the property of) <strong>C</strong> and the lower side in the South on (the property of) <strong>A</strong>, <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong>; the upper front in the West borders on (the property of) <strong>E<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>E<sub>2</sub></strong>, the lower front in the East is adjacent to the Sukull&acirc;tu-street. LINE<br /> <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent for this land together with the seller <strong>B</strong> (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>) to be 1 mina and 10 shekels of silver. He gives (<em>nadānu</em>) <strong>B </strong>the total purchase price plus 1 shekel as additional payment (<em>k&icirc; atri</em>). LINE<br /> The seller acknowledges that he has received (<em>mahāru</em>) in total 1 mina and 11 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), and he is satisfied (<em>apālu </em>&nbsp;G Stat). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. The field will be measured: should it be found smaller or larger than what was originally calculated they will compensate each other (<em>ahāmi&scaron; apālu </em>) according to the field-price ratio (<em>mahīru</em>) they agreed upon. Fingernail impressions (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller <strong>B</strong>, instead of his seal impression (<em>kunukku</em>). Names of 6 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-u&scaron;allim/&Scaron;umu-ukīn//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu; <strong>C</strong> = Marduk-zēru-ibni/Nab&ucirc;-balāssu-iqbi//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu; <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> = Rēmūtu; <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bēl-iddin; <strong>E<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-apli/Nādin-ahi//Adad-&scaron;umu-ēre&scaron;; <strong>E<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bēl&scaron;unu/Nādin-ahi//Adad-&scaron;umu-ēre&scaron;&nbsp;"
