paraphrase: "Promissory note for barley without interest.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 9;0.2 kor of barley to <strong>A</strong> in an interest-free loan (<em>hubuttutu</em>), to be delivered without interest <em>(ina qaqqad</em>i) in Simān (III) of the following year. Delivery is due in Babylon at the entrance to the depot (<em>kalakku</em>) and according to <strong>B</strong>&#39;s measure. Should a previous promissory note about the barley debt turn up (<em>el&ucirc;</em>) it is to be considered invalid (<em>hep&ucirc;, </em>lit. &quot;broken&quot;). A short remark on the tablet&#39;s left edge points out that the above arrangement does not pertain (<em>&scaron;a la</em>) to a promissory note for barley that is held against <strong>C</strong>. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = &Scaron;ulāya/Zēru-ukīn//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= Bēl-iqī&scaron;a/Zēru-ukīn//Munnabittu; <strong>C</strong> = Karbazakka (without affiliation)"
