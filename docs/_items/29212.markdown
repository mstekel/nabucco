paraphrase: "Court protocol: dispute over the sale of a slave<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> said thus to the judges of king Nabonidus: &quot;In the month Abu (V) of Neriglissar&rsquo;s 1<sup>st</sup> regnal year, I sold my slave <strong>C</strong> to <strong>B</strong> for 1/2 mina and 5 shekels of silver. He wrote a promissory note (<em>u&lsquo;iltu</em>) and did not pay the silver&quot;. The judges heard (the plaintiff&rsquo;s statement), brought (<em>abālu</em>) <strong>B</strong> and had him stand before them (<em>uzuzzu </em>&Scaron;). <strong>B</strong> showed (<em>kullumu</em>) the judges the contract (<em>riksu</em>) which he contracted (<em>rakāsu</em>) with <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> and that proved that he had paid off (<em>eṭēru</em>) the remaining silver of the slave&rsquo;s price. <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>D<sub>3</sub></strong> testified (<em>k&acirc;nu </em>D) in front of the judges that their mother <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> had been repaid (<em>eṭēru</em>). The judges have discussed the case and established a fine amounting to 1/2 mina and 5 shekels of silver, the same sum she demanded, to be paid by <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong>. They have given the silver to <strong>B</strong> on the basis of this just decision. Related to this matter are also BM30574 (= Ner 23) and BM30454 (= Ner 42) Names of 6 judges and the scribe: Nergal-bān&ucirc;nu//Rab-ban&ecirc;. The unsealed tablet YBC16313 seems to be a duplicate.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Bēlilitu/Bēl-u&scaron;ēzib//&Scaron;a-nā&scaron;ī&scaron;u(!), mother of <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>D<sub>3</sub></strong>; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Bazūzu; <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> = Zēria, son of <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong>; <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-lī&scaron;ir, son of <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong>; <strong>D<sub>3</sub></strong> = Etellu, son of&nbsp;<strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong><br /> &nbsp;"
