paraphrase: "Security for a silver debt.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 3 minas and 14 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>. He secures this debt in various ways. First he pledges a house that he himself took from <strong>C</strong> in antichresis (<em>ana ma&scaron;kanūti ṣabātu</em>). So, this is a case of after-pledge (German: Unterverpfandung). As extra security, he gives <strong>A</strong> the document recording <strong>C</strong>&#39;s debt (<em>adi u&#39;ilti</em>) and the warranties it includes (<em>pūt na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>). Further he agrees to pay 2 &frac14; shekels of silver as rent for the house to <strong>A</strong> from the 1st of &Scaron;abāṭu (XI) of the 12th year onwards and till the debt is fully repaid. Most likely, the rent guarantees that <strong>B</strong> can continue living in the house. Finally, he pledges <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong>, his slave-cook (<sup>l&uacute;</sup>MU <em>qallu</em>) and his entire property in and outside of the city. No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged person and objects until <strong>A</strong> has received the full repayment of the debt. Eventually, <strong>B</strong>&#39;s son took over the debt (BM31052 = Nbk. 142) and its final settlement occured 4 &frac12; years after the current document (BM30348 = Nbk. 172). Names of xxx witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nergal-uballiṭ/I&scaron;um-uballiṭ//Bēl-ēṭiru; <strong>B</strong> = &Scaron;ulāya/Nab&ucirc;-zēru-ukīn//Egibi; <strong>C </strong>= (Marduk-)&Scaron;āpik-zēri/Marduk-zēru-ibni//&Scaron;ang&ucirc; -Ninurta; <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>D</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ina-ṣilli-Bēl, cook (<sup>l&uacute;</sup>MU) and slave (<em>qallu)</em> of <strong>B</strong>"
