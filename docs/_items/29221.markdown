The present document confirms that the debtors actually received (<em>eṭēru</em>) all of it from <strong>A.</strong> They assume warranty for each other. It is further agreed that<strong> A</strong> is allowed to take away (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) the 2 minas of silver &lt;<em>at<sup>?</sup>&gt;&nbsp; their &hellip; (&lt;</em>ana<sup>?</sup>&gt; <em>ṣib&ucirc;tu</em>) (partly uncl.), besides the promissory note that is issued against them, till the end of the year (followed by a broken passage).
