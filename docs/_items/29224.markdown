paraphrase: "Injunction<br /> On Abu (V), 2<sup>nd</sup>, &nbsp;<strong>A </strong>must hand over his witness at the entrance to <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s (i.e. the canal inspector&rsquo;s = <em>gugallu</em>) house. He will testify against <strong>C</strong>, telling if he took <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s T&Uacute;G.KUR.RA-garment and <em>&scaron;a-qabli </em>garment. If the witness will leave his deposition, then <strong>C</strong> will give the garments back to <strong>A</strong>. If he will not testify, then <strong>C</strong> will go unpunished. If the accused will fail to be present on Abu (V), 2<sup>nd</sup>, he will be sentenced to give back the T&Uacute;G.KUR.RA-garment as well as the <em>&scaron;a-qabli </em>garment even without any witness. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Imbēa/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-ukīn//Mukallimu; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-iddin, canal inspector (<em>gugallu</em>); <strong>C</strong> = Arrabi/Saggilu//Mar-ban&ecirc;"
