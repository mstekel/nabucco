paraphrase: "Deposition.<br /> Concerns <strong>A&#39;s </strong>legal efforts to take possession of four slaves as compensation for having repaid a debt on behalf of <strong>C<sub>1 </sub></strong>&nbsp;and his wife. In Nabonidus&rsquo; 8<sup>th</sup> regnal year, <strong>B</strong> raised a claim against <strong>C<sub>1</sub> </strong>(concerning) 2 1/3 minas of silver, and issued a promissory note against him and his wife <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong>. He took their children <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>3</sub></strong> and <strong>D<sub>4</sub></strong>, their house and every property they held inside and outside the city as a pledge. They guaranteed <em>for each other</em> and <strong>A</strong> guaranteed for the payment as well. Now, <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> did not pay; he and his wife died &ndash; after which <strong>B</strong> brought <strong>A</strong> in front of Nabonidus&#39; judges who looked into the written legal evidence (<em>riksu</em>). They entitled (<em>ra</em><em>&scaron;&ucirc; </em>&Scaron;) <strong>A</strong> to those 2 1/3 minas of silver, apart from the silver that he had previously given to the creditor. &nbsp;<strong>A</strong> paid the silver to <strong>B</strong>, he has given <strong>A</strong> the promissory note as well as a copy (<em>gabr</em><em>&ucirc;</em>) of the process protocol (<em>ṭ</em><em>uppi d</em><em>īni</em>). The judges referred <strong>A</strong> back (<em>nah</em><em>ā</em><em>su </em>&Scaron;) to <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s house to recup his silver from the inheritance. <strong>A</strong> then brought <strong>E<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s heir (<em>iar</em><em>ī</em><em>tu</em>) and <strong><sup>f</sup>E<sub>2</sub></strong>, his sister-in-law, before the judges. They looked into his documents and <strong>E<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>F</strong>&nbsp;declared that they don&#39;t want to take up <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s inheritance (<em>iarit</em><em>ū</em><em>tu ep</em><em>ē&scaron;</em><em>u</em>) and agree that <strong>A</strong> takes as pay-off (<em>&scaron;</em><em>al</em><em>ā</em><em>mu</em> G) from <strong>C</strong>&#39;s property (<em>nikkassu</em>) and from the slaves (<em>amīlūtu</em>) that had been pledged to him. Thus they (fem. pl.) undid <strong>A</strong>&#39;s document (<em>ṭ</em><em>uppu pa</em><em>ṭā</em><em>ru</em> G; partly uncl.) and &hellip; (verb broken off). &nbsp;From the following fragmentary passage, that continues to report <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s speech, it becomes clear that he took possession (<em>ab</em><em>ā</em><em>ku</em>) of the four slaves (<strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>3</sub></strong> and <strong>D<sub>4</sub></strong> ) for the <em>3</em> minas and 50 shekels of silver, covering future as well as previous claims against <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s and <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2. </sub></strong>As a result the slaves are at his disposal (<em>ina p</em><em>ā</em><em>ni</em>). His document related to their status of free persons (<em>mār ban&ecirc;</em>) is sealed. The end of the plaintiff&#39;s speech is damaged: it mentions the issue of bringing along witnesses (<em>mudd</em><em>&ucirc;</em><em> ab</em><em>ā</em><em>ku</em>) and taking an oath by <strong>E<sub>1</sub></strong><sub>-<strong>2</strong></sub>, (<strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s two nephew) and <strong>G</strong>. This is followed by a break of about 10 lines. At the end the judges, <em>having heard</em> the witnesses (<em>mukinn</em><em>ūtu</em>) &nbsp;<em>gave</em> (verb reconstructed) <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong>, mother of <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>2 </sub></strong>&nbsp;and the slaves &hellip;<strong><sup> f</sup></strong><strong>D<sub>2 </sub></strong>to <strong>A</strong>. A month later the case is readdressed in BM30645 (=Nbn 668). Names of 7 judges and 2 scribes; third listed witness-judge is Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi.<br /> <br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-rēmanni/L&acirc;bā&scaron;i-Marduk//A&scaron;gandu; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-ukīn/Ibnāya//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Nanāya; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Arad-Gula/Nab&ucirc;-ile&rsquo;&rsquo;i//Bā&#39;iru; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Damqāya, wife of C<sub>1</sub>; <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ana-Ta&scaron;mētu-atkal, slave of C<sub>1</sub> and <sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub>; <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Amtia, daughter of <sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub>; <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>3</sub> </strong>= <sup>f</sup>Nanāya-ana-bīti&scaron;u, daughter of <sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub>; <strong>D<sub>4</sub></strong> = Zababa-iddina, son of <sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub>; <strong>E<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nergal-uballiṭ(/Bēl-nāṣir//Bā&#39;iru), nephew and heir of C<sub>1</sub>; <strong>E</strong><sub>2</sub> = <em>R</em><em>ī</em><em>m</em><em>ū</em><em>t-B</em><em>ē</em><em>l</em>(/Bēl-nāṣir//Bā&#39;iru), nephew of C<sub>1</sub>; <strong><sup>f</sup>F</strong>&nbsp;= <sup>f</sup>Reminni-I&scaron;tar, sister of <sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub>; <strong>G</strong> = ... /Gahal."
