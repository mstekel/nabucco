paraphrase: "Testimonies (a.o. under oath) about the role of a slave as witness. Fragmentary.<br /> A large part of this fragmentarily preserved document consists of declarations in direct speech in which the role of <strong>C</strong>, witness to a property transfer, is discussed. In the opening lines, in fact, <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> declares under oath (<em>nī&scaron; zakāru</em>) before the judges (<em>dayyānu</em>) that he does not know (<em>id&ucirc;)</em><strong> C,</strong> the third witness listed in the tablet (<em>ṭuppu</em>) that records the transfer of assets (<em>nikkassu</em>) to <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong>. The name of the donor is lost in a lacuna, but can safely be reconstructed as <strong>B</strong>, and if we assume that <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> the beneficiary, was his wife, we are dealing with a property transfer between husband and wife. Then<strong> A</strong><sub>2 </sub>testifies (verb is broken off) before <strong>D</strong>, the governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>) of Babylon that when <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> (the donor) fell ill, he sent <strong>E</strong> to someone (possibly <strong>C</strong>), asking him to come over. He (possibly <strong>C) </strong>eventually went to <strong>B<sub>1</sub> </strong>(<em>ana pāni alāku</em>) and they decided not to bring suit against <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> (<em>itti dabābu</em>). The following fragmentary passage mentions <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s arable land (<em>zēru</em>) and building plots (<em>qan&ucirc;</em>), and again states that &quot;they did not bring suit&quot;. It seems that a dispute had arisen about some of the assets that <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>had transferred to <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, but that it eventually did not lead to a formal lawsuit. In the final lines, mostly lost, the role of <strong>C</strong> is brought up again in directly quoted testimonies by persons whose identity cannot be established. It is claimed that he could strictly speaking not act as witness (<em>&scaron;ībū</em>), considering the fact that he is a slave (<em>qallu </em>&scaron;ū). Someone apparently allowed him to be listed (<em>&scaron;aṭāru</em>) among the witnesses since they were both present (<em>amāru</em>, lit. &quot;to see&quot;) when the purchase price was paid (<em>mahīru nad&acirc;nu)</em>. Finally, in a direct speech someone states that although <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>&#39;s tablet has been changed (<em>en&ucirc;</em>), he/she remembers (<em>hasāsu</em>) to whom it had been given. On the lower edge of the tablet there are the seal impressions of 5 judges: <strong>F<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>F<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong>F<sub>3</sub></strong>, <strong>F<sub>4</sub></strong>, <strong>F<sub>5</sub></strong>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = (name broken off)]; <strong>A</strong><sub>2</sub> = (name broken off); <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-apli;&nbsp; <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Bunanītu; <strong>C</strong> = Nergal-&scaron;umu-iddin/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-ibni//Ri&scaron;ana-Esangila; <strong>D</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-iddin, <em>&scaron;ākin ṭēm</em> Bābili; <strong>E</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir-nap&scaron;āti; <strong>F<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nergal-Bān&ucirc;nu, judge; <strong>F<sub> 2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin, judge; <strong>F<sub> 3</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-ukīn, judge; <strong>F<sub> 4</sub></strong> = Bēl-ēṭir, judge; <strong>F<sub> 5</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-balāssu-iqbi, judge"
