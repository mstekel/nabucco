paraphrase: "Agreement about the measurement of a field after the sale and after the seller&rsquo;s death.<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchased 1 kor (13500 m<sup>2</sup>) of arable land (<em>zēru</em>) from <strong>B</strong> (<em>ana kaspi mahāru</em>) in &Scaron;abāṭ of Cambyses 2<sup>nd</sup> year. Part of the land is already cultivated (<em>mēre&scaron;u</em>), while the other part is newly prepared for cultivation (<em>tapt&ucirc;</em>) and it includes scattered date palms. On the day of the purchase, they put the agreement down in writing in a sealed document; the buyer took a written and sealed copy of the agreement (<em>kanāku </em>- <em>leq&ucirc;</em>), which also specifically clarifies (<em>&scaron;ūd&ucirc;</em> [<em>ed&ucirc;</em>]) that they will check the measurements of that field. Should it be found larger or smaller (<em>atru u maṭ&ucirc;</em>) than what was originally calculated, they will compensate each other (<em>ahāme&scaron; apālu </em>). However, the seller died before the land could be measured. After a gap in the tablet, the text resumes and mentions the name of <strong>C</strong>, possibly a neighbour whose plot of land extended up to the dam of the <em>han&scaron;&ucirc;</em> (<em>makall&ucirc; &scaron;a han&scaron;ānē</em>). The passage is too broken to determine the exact context. At the end of the document, <strong>A</strong> agrees with <strong>D</strong> (no doubt the seller&rsquo;s legal successor) that they will not make claims against each other about the measurement of the field. To seal the deal, they both pronounce an oath. Names of 6 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Bazūzu/Etellu//I&scaron;paru; <strong>C</strong> = Marduk-rēmanni/N[ab&ucirc;-&hellip;]; <strong>D</strong> = Bēl-ahhē-iddin"
