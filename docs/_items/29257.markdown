paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> Fragment of a tablet: only the final part of the text with the closing formulas is preserved. The buyer, <strong>B</strong>, acknowledges that he has received the full amount of silver that was due for his field and he is satisfied (<em>apālu </em>&nbsp;G Stat). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other; should someone from the Andahar (i.e. the seller&rsquo;s) family complain against this purchase, the claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the received silver. One final clause states that should a claim (<em>paqāru</em>) arise (<em>ba&scaron;&ucirc; </em>N) <strong>C</strong>, <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s brother, will clear the property (<em>murruqu</em>) and will hand it over to the buyer, <strong>A</strong>. Names of 2+ witnesses; name of the scribe lost.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-uballiṭ/Lūṣi-ana-nūr//Andahar; <strong>C</strong> = Iddin-Bēl/Lūṣi-ana-nūr//Andahar"
