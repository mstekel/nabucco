paraphrase: "Purchase of land. Transfer of silver to the Esagila as compensatory payment.<br /> The tablet records the purchase of agricultural land; the text has been divided into paragraphs, marked on the tablet by a line drawn at the end of each one (and indicated below in the paraphrase by LINE).<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases 24 Kor (324000 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) from the four brothers <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>4</sub></strong>. The land is located in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>), and it consists partly of cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) and partly of cultivated as well as newly cleared land (<em>mēre&scaron;u u tapt&ucirc;</em>) above and below the New Canal in from of the Enlil Gate, in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon. LINE<br /> Its upper side in the West borders on (the property of) <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>4</sub></strong> and its lowers side in the East on (the property of) <strong>D</strong>. Its upper front in the North borders on the royal domain (<em>eqel pīhat &scaron;arri</em>) and its lower front on the dam of the&nbsp;<em>han&scaron;u</em>s (<em>makall&ucirc; &scaron;a han&scaron;ānē</em>). LINE<br /> 2 kor (27000 m<sup>2</sup>) of this land is planted with big date palms whose value (<em>&scaron;uqultu</em>) corresponds to 9 minas of silver, i.e. 1 shekel of silver for each 6 2/3 gar (50 m<sup>2</sup>); 1;4.1.4 Kor (25050 m<sup>2</sup>) is planted with young date palms (<em>tālāni</em>) whose value (<em>&scaron;uqultu</em>) corresponds to 2 minas and 47 shekels of silver, i.e. 1 shekel of silver for each 20 GAR (150 m<sup>2</sup>). The remaining 20;0.4.2 Kor (271950 m<sup>2</sup>) is cultivated as well as newly cleared land (<em>mēre&scaron;u u tapt&ucirc;</em>) whose value (<em>&scaron;uqultu</em>) corresponds to 10 minas and 4 1/3 shekels of silver, i.e. 1 shekel of silver for each 60 GAR (450 m<sup>2</sup>). <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent for this land together with the sellers <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>4</sub></strong> (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc;</em>) to be 21 minas and 51 1/3 shekels of silver for its total price, plus 28 2/3 shekels of silver as additional price (<em>k&icirc; atar</em>). LINE<br /> In total, the four brothers have received 22 minas and 20 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), corresponding to the total price for this field. The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>4</sub>, </strong>then, hand over this silver to the Esagila as compensatory payment (<em>&scaron;ullundu</em>): they were in fact in debt for oxen that were part of Marduk&rsquo;s property (<em>makkūru</em>). Names of 8 witnesses (the <em>&scaron;ākin-ṭēmi </em>of Babylon and 7 judges) and of 4 scribes. The tablet shows multiple fingernail and seal impressions.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>= Marduk-&scaron;ākin-&scaron;umi/Marduk-ēṭir//Ēṭiru; <strong>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Iqī&scaron;a-Marduk/Marduk-ēṭir//Ēṭiru; <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-bān-ahi/Marduk-ēṭir//Ēṭiru; <strong>B<sub>4</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir-nap&scaron;āti/Marduk-ēṭir//Ēṭiru; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Silīm-Bēl/Arad-Nergal//Ibni-ilu; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Marduk-&scaron;umu-uṣur/Iddinnunu/Bēl-ēṭiru; <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-aplu-iddin/Marduk-&scaron;arrani//Itinnu; <strong>C<sub>4</sub></strong> = Kalbāya/Zākiru//Bēl-ēṭiru; <strong>D</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēre&scaron;/&Scaron;ulāya//S&icirc;n-nādin-&scaron;umi"
