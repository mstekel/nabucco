paraphrase: "House rental.<br /> <strong>A</strong> rents a house located at (<em>ina</em>) the Gi&scaron;&scaron;u-Gate to <strong>B</strong> for 3 years, for a yearly rental price amounting to 16 shekels of silver. The renter should caulk (<em>&scaron;an&ucirc;</em>) and repair the roof. He should pay for the additional payment (<em>nūptu</em>) in Nisan (I), D&ucirc;zu (IV) and Kislim (IX); it is also agreed that half of the silver should be paid at the beginning of the year, and the remainder in the middle. The house is at the renter&rsquo;s disposal from the 1<sup>st</sup> day of a month whose name is broken. <strong>B </strong>has already paid (verb broken off) 8 shekels of silver from the rental price. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Arad-Bēl/Kalbāya//&Scaron;umu-lib&scaron;i"
