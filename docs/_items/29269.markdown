paraphrase: "Interim settlement of accounts in court, within the framework of a business partnership.<br /> Concerns the business partnership that <strong>A</strong> and his son <strong>B</strong> ran <strong>C</strong> and <strong>D</strong> as their co-workers (<em>&scaron;utāpu</em>) between Nabopolassar&#39;s 18th year and Nebuchadnezzar&#39;s 18th year, i.e. for at least 21 years. The partners settle their accounts before the judges (<em>nikkassu epē&scaron;u</em>);&nbsp; It is decided (<em>parāsu</em>) that <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> (still) owe 50 shekels of silver, but that there are no other claims between them. The partnership is dissolved, an oath before the community (<em>puhru</em>) and the gods has been taken (<em>nī&scaron;u zakāru</em>), and their accounts are settled (<em>epu&scaron; nikkassi qat&ucirc;</em>). All&nbsp; promissory notes have been broken (i.e. invalidated). Names of xxx witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-apli, father of B; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-Bēl&scaron;unu, son of C; <strong>C</strong> = &Scaron;ulāya/&Scaron;Nab&ucirc;-)Zēru-ukīn(//Egibi); <strong>D</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl (without affiliation)"
