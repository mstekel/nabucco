paraphrase: "Land rental.<br /> The top of the tablet is broken off. The document concerns land located on the New Canal, rented by <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> to <strong>B</strong>. The renter should irrigate it by drawing water from a well (<em>ina dālu dal&ucirc;</em>). Both <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> will enjoy the yield. The renter should dig a ditch above the canal. In a broken context, arable land (<em>zēru</em>) belonging to <strong>C</strong> is mentioned. The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Quda&scaron;u; <strong>B</strong> = &Scaron;ulāya/Marduk-&scaron;umu-uṣur//Edu-ēṭir; <strong>C</strong> = Nergal-ēṭir"
