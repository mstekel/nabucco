paraphrase: "Sale of a slave<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and his wife <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>2</sub></strong> gave their slave <strong>C </strong>to <strong>B</strong> as a pledge for 50 shekels of silver, and they have set a due date (<em>adannu</em>) (for the payment of their debt). Now (since the term has passed by and they cannot pay), <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> sell this slave to <strong>B</strong>, for an <em>hariṣ</em>-price amounting to 50 shekels of silver. The sellers guarantee against (suits brought by) a person acting unlawfully (<em>sēh&ucirc;</em>) or a person raising claims (<em>pāqirānu</em>) about this slave. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu/Zēria; <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ēṭirtu/Ahhē-iddin, wife of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>B</strong> = Tē&scaron;&ecirc;-ēṭir/Nab&ucirc;-le&#39;&rsquo;i//&Scaron;ama&scaron;-abārī; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;ma-attū&#39;a"
