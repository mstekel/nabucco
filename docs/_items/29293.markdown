The buyer pays the total purchase price, plus 17 shekels of silver as additional payment and a garment for the lady of the (sold) house. <strong>B </strong>acknowledges that he has received in total 8 minas and 57 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), and he is satisfied (<em>apil</em>). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. What remained of <strong>B</strong>&#39;s debt to Marduk&#39;s temple has been settled with the silver from the sale (<em>kaspu &scaron;īm bīt &scaron;uāti ana makkūr Marduk nadin</em>).
