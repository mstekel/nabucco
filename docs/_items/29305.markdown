paraphrase: "Settlement of a silver debt.<br /> Concerns the claim for payment (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) which <strong>A</strong> holds against <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> and (originally) <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, his father. The parties shall not sue each other (<em>ragāmu</em> D) in the future, as the entire debt <em>(ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em> <em>gabbu</em>) has been paid off (<em>eṭēru</em>, G Stat.). The document also relates to <strong>C</strong>&#39;s debt (to <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>) for which his house had been given in antichresis as security: <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> had after-pledged this house to <strong>A</strong> together with his creditnote (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) and the securities it included, a.o. the guarantees given by &Scaron;ulāya (=<strong>B<sub>1 </sub></strong>or <strong>D</strong>?) and <strong>E</strong> that the debt be repaid (<em>pūt eṭēri na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>). This debt is settled as well (<em>eṭēru</em>, G Stat.). Any document (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) that should turn up in <strong>A</strong>&#39;s house about a claim for payment (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) to him against <strong>B<sub>2,</sub></strong> &Scaron;ulāya (=<strong>B<sub>1 </sub></strong>or <strong>D</strong>?), <strong>C </strong>or <strong>E</strong>, is considered invalid (lit. &quot;broken&quot;, <em>hep&ucirc;</em> D, wr. <em>hu-up-pa-a&#39;</em>). Names of 5 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nergal-uballiṭ/I&scaron;um-uballiṭ//Bēl-ēṭiru; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = &Scaron;ulāya/Nab&ucirc;-zēru-ukīn//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>C</strong>= (Marduk-)&scaron;āpik-zēri/Marduk-zāru-ibni//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Ninurta; <strong>D</strong> = &Scaron;ulāya, without affiliation (either = <strong>B<sub>1 </sub></strong>or another &Scaron;ulāya); <strong>E</strong> = Arad-Bēl, without affiliation."
