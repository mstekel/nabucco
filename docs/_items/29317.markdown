The parties agree that the investors are entitled to a share in whatever the slaves make with the silver and the barrels in or out of town that equals that of the slaves. <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>should be fed (<em>aklu akālu</em> G, lit. &quot;eat bread&quot;)) and clothed (<em>mu%iptu</em> <em>katāmu</em> N) for the entire period that they run the business (<em>na&scaron;partu alāku</em>), and this in addition (<em>elat</em>) to the household utensils that are (already) at their disposal. Names of xxx witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = Marduk-&Scaron;āpik-zēri/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-iddin//Nādin-&scaron;e&#39;im; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = &Scaron;ēpit-Nab&ucirc;-aṣbat, slave of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-dīni-epu&scaron;, slave of <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin"
