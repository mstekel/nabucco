paraphrase: "Fragment of a tablet concerning liabilities.<br /> The content of this document cannot be reconstructed with certainty, given the poor condition of the tablet. In the first lines, one finds the name of a scribe (<em>ṭup&scaron;arru</em>), <strong>A</strong>. Then, a debt owed by <strong>B</strong> is mentioned &ndash; followed by fields (<em>eqlu</em>), houses (<em>bītu</em>) and possibly slaves (the word <em>amīlūtu</em> is lost because of a gap at the beginning of the line). In the following fragmentary passage the name of <strong>C</strong> is mentioned, followed by an unknown amount of silver that is at <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s disposal. <strong>E</strong> [&hellip;] has received (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) for the payment of the creditors (<em>ana eṭēru &scaron;a rā&scaron;&ucirc;ti</em>) [&hellip;] In the final fragmentary passage three more names can be read: those of <strong>F<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>F<sub>2</sub></strong>, and <strong>G</strong>. Names of 3 witnesses and 2 scribes: [Kabti-ilī-Marduk]//Atkuppu and [Libūru]//Nab&ucirc;nnāya.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Libūru, scribe; <strong>B</strong> = Kidin-Marduk; <strong>C</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>D</strong> = Rēmūtu; <strong>E</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-rīhtu-uṣur; <strong>F<sub>1</sub></strong> = Arad-Bēl; <strong>F<sub>2</sub></strong> = Ahhea; <strong>G</strong> = Marduk-&scaron;umu"
