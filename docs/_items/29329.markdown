It consists of cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) bearing fruit (<em>iṣṣi bilti</em>), located in front of the I&scaron;tar Gate in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon, at the opening of the ancient Kutha canal.<br /> The upper long side in the North borders on (the property of) <strong>A</strong>, the lower side in the South on (the property of) <strong>C</strong>; the upper front in the West is adjacent to the bank (<em>ki&scaron;ādu</em>) of the Euphrates and the lower front in the East to the royal street (<em>harrān &scaron;arri</em>). <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent for this land, 1;0.5 Kor (15750 m<sup>2</sup>), together with the seller <strong>B</strong> (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>) to be 16 shekels of silver per 0;0.1 kor (450 m<sup>2</sup>) of land.

The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received.
