paraphrase: "Inheritance division: allocation of shares.<br /> In its opening lines, the text mentions a previous document issued by <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> und <strong>A<sub>3</sub> </strong>(<strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s sons), according to which they divided their shares (<em>z&acirc;zu</em>), by mutual agreement (<em>mitgurtu</em>). They agreed that the property of the business partnership (<em>harrānu</em>) established by their father and <strong>C</strong> would remain undivided (<em>kar&ucirc;</em>). Afterwards, in Cambyses&rsquo; 3<sup>rd</sup> regnal year, <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> allocated (<em>uzzuzu</em>, lit. &ldquo;registered in the account&rdquo;) to <strong>C</strong> a share in [x] kor of land planted with trees and grain (<em>zēru zaqpu u mēre&scaron;u</em>), as well as 2 female slaves, <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>2</sub></strong>. In Ta&scaron;rīt (VII) of a year which cannot be determined since the numeral is lost in a lacuna, <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong> settled their accounts (<em>nikkassu qat&ucirc;</em>) [&hellip;] (short launa) <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong> did not allocate a share in the 37 1/2 shekels of silver to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>, his older brother. <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong> sold (lit. &ldquo;gave&rdquo;, <em>nadānu</em>) to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> his entire share in (the property located in) Bit[...]. In Cambyses&rsquo; 7<sup>th</sup> regnal year, the same 2 brothers agreed on the allocation of their shares (<em>uzzuzu</em>, lit. &ldquo;registered in the account&rdquo;) in the land located on the New Canal, which their father <strong>B</strong> assigned to their mother <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>E</strong> by means of a sealed document (<em>kanāku </em><em>- dagālu </em>&Scaron;), providing that she would enjoy a lifelong usufruct of it (<em>akalu akālu</em>), and that after her death the land would become part of her sons&rsquo; assets. <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> transferred the property of his share (in this land) to his brother <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong>, writing the agreement in a sealed document (<em>kanāku</em><em>-dagālu </em>&Scaron;); then, <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong> sold (lit. &ldquo;gave&rdquo;, <em>nadānu</em>) the land that was <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>&rsquo;s share to his nephew <strong>F </strong>(the eldest son of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>), for 3 1/2 minas of silver. He received (<em>eṭēru</em>) this entire sum from <strong>F</strong>. As for the land located in Dilbat, this remains at <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong>&rsquo;s disposal. As for the house located near <strong>G</strong>&rsquo;s property, which <strong>A<sub>3 </sub></strong>pledged (<em>ma&scaron;kanu &scaron;akānu</em>) for 2 1/2 minas to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>: he will pay this sum of silver to <strong>F</strong>, and <strong>F</strong> will give him the house back (<em>m</em><em>u&scaron;&scaron;uru</em>). The 2 1/2 minas cannot be counted (<em>man&ucirc;</em>) among the 3 1/2 minas of silver (which <strong>F</strong> owes for the purchase of <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>&rsquo;s share). <strong>F</strong> will release (<em>zak&ucirc;</em> D) his father&rsquo;s (<strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>) promissory note (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) related to 2 minas and 37 1/2 shekels of silver owed by <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong>, and he will give it to the debtor. <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong> confirms that he did not (? The text is broken and its interpretation must be considered as speculative) sell the arable land (<em>zēru</em>) in Dilbat nor the one located at the opening (<em>bitqu</em>) of the Ile&rsquo;&rsquo;i-Bēl canal, whose surface amounts to 0;0.0.4 1/2 sq. kor (c. 337,5 m<sup>2</sup>) and that corresponds to <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>&rsquo;s fourth share, to <strong>F</strong>. The end of the tablet is fragmentary, but one can infer that the parties to this agreement take an oath to seal their accord.
