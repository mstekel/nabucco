paraphrase: "Promissory note for assessed field rent (<em>imittu</em>), to be delivered in dates.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 10 kor of dates, the assessed field rent (<em>imitti eqli</em>) on land that belongs to <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong>&#39;s dowry (<em>nudunn&ucirc;</em>). It is her 1/5<sup>th</sup> share in the rent income that she earns together with <strong>C</strong>. <strong>B</strong> should deliver the dates (- it is not explicitly said to whom -) in one payment according to the measure of <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> &#39;s father. Delivery is due in Arahsamna (VIII). He should also deliver the usual by-products of the date cultivation: for each kor of dates he shall give spathes (<em>tuhallu</em>), spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>), fibres (<em>mangagu</em>), a load of firewood, (and) 1 <em>darīku</em>-container. There is still another claim (<em>ra&scaron;ūtu</em>) against <strong>B</strong> that is still pending. The settlement of accounts (<em>epi&scaron;ti nikkassi</em>) with the debtor concerning the <em>imittu</em>-dates of the 26<sup>th</sup> year is not yet completed (<em>qat&ucirc;</em>). Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A&nbsp;</strong>=&nbsp;<sup>f</sup>Eri&scaron;tu, daughter of <strong>D</strong>; <strong>B&nbsp;</strong>= Madān-iddin/ Ubār//Itinnu; <strong>C&nbsp;</strong>= Marduk-&scaron;umu-ibni/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;arru-uṣur; <strong>D&nbsp;</strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi"
