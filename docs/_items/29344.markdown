paraphrase: "Decision record, royal judges. About the settlement of a silver debt after the debtors&#39; death<br /> <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and his wife (<strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong>) owed 3 minas and 50 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>. See also Mnb1809 (= TCL 12 122). A legal dispute arose about this debt between the creditor and <strong>C</strong>, the debtors&#39; heir (<em>iarītu</em>), set against the background of the inheritance of the couple&#39;s property (<em>nikkassu</em>) in general, and their encumbered slaves (<em>amīlūtu bīt ma&scaron;kān</em>i) in particular. <strong>C</strong> declared that he does not want to take upon himself (<em>epē&scaron;u</em>) his father&#39;s inheritance (<em>iaritūtu</em>), and A should satisfy his claim (<em>&scaron;alāmu</em>) from (<em>ina</em>) the lien (<em>bīt ma&scaron;kāni</em>) on <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>&#39;s slaves (<em>amīlūtu</em>) . Thereupon (<em>arki</em>), the creditor brought (<em>abālu</em>) four slaves (<strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong>-<sub>4</sub>) from <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>&#39;s household (<em>ni&scaron;ū bīti</em>) whom had been pledged to him before (<em>ana mahar</em>) the king&#39;s judges. They decide in his favor, and grant him the ownership over the slaves (<em>pāni &scaron;udgulu</em>) in lieu of (<em>kūm</em>) his claim of 3 minas and 50, being equal to the slaves&#39; full market value (<em>&scaron;īmu</em>). They have been transferred to him <em>(nadānu</em>), he has received them (<em>mahāru</em>) and is satisfied (<em>apālu</em>) so that he cannot bring suit in the future (<em>rugummu ul ī&scaron;u</em>). In order that there may never again be a lawsuit (<em>la sahāru-ma la ragāmu</em>) in the future (<em>matima</em>) about these slaves, the judges issued a written statement (<em>ṭuppu &scaron;aṭāru</em>), sealed it (<em>barāmu</em>) with their seals and gave it to <strong>A</strong>. Names of 5 witnesses, all judges (<em>dayyānu</em>), introduced by the formula <em>ina mahar</em> &quot;before&quot; and further identified as <em>ṭuppi &scaron;āṭir</em> &quot;writer of the tablet&quot;. Second listed witness-judge is Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-rēmanni/L&acirc;bā&scaron;i-Marduk//A&scaron;gandu; <strong>B<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Arad-Gula(/Nab&ucirc;-ile&rsquo;&rsquo;i//Bā&#39;iru); <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> =<sup>&nbsp; f</sup>Damqāya, wife of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>C </strong>= Nergal-uballiṭ; <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ana-Ta&scaron;mētu-atkal, slave of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Amtia, slave of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>3 </sub></strong>= Nanāya-ana-bīti&scaron;u, slave of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>D<sub>4</sub></strong> = Zababa-iddina, slave of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>."
