paraphrase: "About a debt for silver. With pledge.<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> issued a promissory note for 1/2 minas of silver against <strong>B</strong> in D&ucirc;zu (IV), - exact day is broken off. After she took something or someone (the pertinent passage is badly preserved) as pledge , she gave(?) to <strong>C</strong> ... (and again, the passage is very fragmentary).&nbsp; Names of xxx witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Bān&acirc;tu-Esagil/&Scaron;umu-iddin; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Ban&ecirc;/&Scaron;umu-iddin"
