paraphrase: "Sale of a donkey. Fragmentary.<br /> The left side and middle part of the tablet are broken.<br /> <strong>A</strong> <em>sells</em> <strong>B</strong> an earth-coloured she-donkey for 1 mina 14 shekels of silver. The description of this donkey in the first 3 lines is fragmentary. Legible are <em>&scaron;a-hi-</em><sup>&lceil;</sup>x<sup>&rceil;</sup> and <em>ina muhhi</em> <em>tikki</em>. A party (name broken) assumes guaranty against a person with prior claims (<em>u&scaron;k&ucirc;tu</em>) to the donkey. From here the rest of the tablet is broken. Fragmentary list of witnesses, including a member of the Egibi family. The scribe is <em>Marduk-nāṣir-apli/</em>Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong>=Bulluṭu/&hellip;-zēru-ibni; <strong>B</strong>=Ardia/Dādia//Nabāya"
