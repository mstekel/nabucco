paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) from a woman whose name is lost; also the description of the property is incomplete because of the poor condition of the beginning of the tablet. A few details on the neighbouring fields are still extant &ndash; the upper side is adjacent to (the property of) P]N and the lower side to (the property of) <strong>B</strong>; the lower front borders on (the property of) <strong>C</strong>. In total, this plot of land measures [x.x.]+1,5 Kor (20250+ m<sup>2</sup>), including (<em>adi</em>) 0;2.3 Kor (6750 m<sup>2</sup>) of wasteland (<em>ki&scaron;ubb&ucirc;</em>, reconstructed): <strong>A</strong> has declared the equivalent for this land together with the seller (A <em>itti</em> <sup>f</sup>PN <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>). The precise amount of silver that has been established between the two as purchase price is lost in a lacuna of the tablet; only the sum given as additional payment (<em>k&icirc; atri</em>), 5 shekels, is preserved. The rest of the document in which the seller acknowledges that she received the full amount of silver and which records the warranty clause against future claims between the parties is severely damaged. The bottom half of the tablet with the list of witnesses, the name of the scribe and the date and place of issue of the document itself is completely broken off.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Mura&scaron;&ucirc;/&hellip;//Arad-Nergal; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-ittannu/&hellip;//Arad-Nergal"
