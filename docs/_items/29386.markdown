paraphrase: "Fragment of tablet about land.<br /> The tablet is severely damaged; a plot of land is mentioned in its opening lines, but the context in which it appears is doubtful. From what is extant one infers that in the past <strong>A</strong> bought from <strong>B</strong> a plot of land located in &Scaron;uppatu which was adjacent to his property and to that of <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>. The purchase price they agreed upon was 58 2/3 shekels of silver. Every other information is lost; the tablet certainly did not record a purchase of land, but it must have established some provisions related to this previous deal. Names of 5 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Mukīn-Marduk/Arad-Nab&ucirc;//As&ucirc;; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Nidintu-Bāba/Rēmūt"
