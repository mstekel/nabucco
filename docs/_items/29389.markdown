paraphrase: "Purchase of a house<br /> This contract refers to a surface area of 32;0.5.14 gi (c. 401,77 m<sup>2</sup>) on which stands a built house (<em>bītu ep&scaron;u</em>) and one in ruins (<em>abtu</em>), and still another part is unbuilt (<em>ki&scaron;ubb&ucirc;</em>). The description of its location and neighbours is fragmentarily preserved. It is located in Bīt-Hursagkalamma in Ki&scaron;, near the house of the sons of Bēl-&scaron;umu-ibni/Miṣiraa to the west and near the house of <strong>B</strong> and the street [&hellip;] to the east [&hellip;].&nbsp; <strong>A </strong>sells it (verb broken off) to a man whose name is broken off. The price is broken off as well. The seller&#39;s mother (whose name is broken off) was present (<em>ina a&scaron;ābi</em>) at the sale. Names of 6 witnesses, 3 of whom belong to the same family as one of the neighbours (Miṣirāya), and the scribe: Tukulti-Marduk/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-ukīn//Atkuppu.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Mu&scaron;allim-Marduk/&hellip;; <strong>B</strong> = Bābilāya/&hellip;"
