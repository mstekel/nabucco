paraphrase: "Interim settlement of accounts within the framework of a business partnership (harranu). Fragmentary.<br /> The document opens with a list of items, but their amounts are damaged. It concerns at least 100 vats for new, first-quality beer (<em>rē&scaron;tu</em>), and broken amounts of&nbsp; vats for old, first-quality beer empty vats,&nbsp; fermenting vats (<em>namzītu</em>), 4<sup>+</sup> slaves, 30<sup>+</sup> kor of dates, 10<sup>+</sup> kor of mustard seeds, x various amounts of silver, a.o. 7 shekels for the purchase of 80 kor of <em>limestone/dung</em>(?) ( <em>abattu</em>) and 1 shekel&nbsp; for the purchase of kor of cress (<em>sahl&ucirc;</em>). In total, 7 minas and 1 shekel of silver that have been inspected in the house (<em>amāru</em>). This is followed by a badly preserved passage which lists 60 kor of dates and miscellaneous amounts of silver that were put&nbsp; at the disposal (ina pāni) of 5&nbsp; named individuals (<strong>C<sub>1-5</sub></strong>). Further also the&nbsp; 1 mina and 5 1/12 shekels of silver at <strong>C<sub>6</sub></strong>&rsquo;s disposal&nbsp; of which 14 &frac12; shekels were&nbsp; debited from the account tablet (l<em>ēˀu </em>) that registers&nbsp; disbursals (<em>tēlītu</em>) since the 15<sup>th</sup> of [name of month is broken off] of the 3<sup>rd</sup> year, 20 2/3 shekels of scrap silver were paid out to/for (<em>tēlītu</em>) [&hellip;] and 30 shekels of silver that were lent out in Neriglissar&rsquo;s 0<sup>th</sup> year and are still outstanding. This brings us to a total of 10 minas and 28 shekels of silver in the business account of <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> that are are placed at <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s disposal. [The name is broken off] promises under oath (<em>tam&ucirc;</em>) to(?) <strong>A </strong>that if <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong> , but at this point the tablet breaks off.
