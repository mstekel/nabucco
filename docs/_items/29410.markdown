paraphrase: "Land rental.<br /> <strong>A</strong> gives land cultivated with grain (<em>zēru p&icirc; &scaron;ulpu</em>) located in &Scaron;uppatu, along the Piqūdu Canal, for 3 years to <strong>B</strong>, for cultivation (<em>errē&scaron;ūtu</em>). He should hoe (<em>dek&ucirc;</em>) and turn over (<em>pa&scaron;āru</em>) the ground, and [&hellip;]. As long as he will watch over it, he will pay the <em>&scaron;ib&scaron;u</em>-tax to the landlord just as the neighbour (<em>it&ucirc;</em>) who lives above. Should he let the field go fallow (<em>nad&ucirc;</em> &Scaron;), he shall still pay the <em>&scaron;ib&scaron;u</em>-tax just as the neighbour (<em>it&ucirc;</em>) who lives above. He does not have to deliver the <em>&scaron;ib&scaron;u</em>-tax for the first year. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl/Kunāya//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu"
