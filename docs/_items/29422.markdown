paraphrase: "Gift of a slave.<br /> <strong>A </strong>has written a sealed document (<em>kanāku</em>) with which he released (<em>mār ban&ucirc;ti nadānu</em>) <strong>B</strong>, his slave who is called Rēmūtu, on the condition that <strong>B</strong> will provide him with food (<em>kurummatu</em>) and clothing (<em>lubū&scaron;u</em>). However, <strong>B</strong> fled (<em>halāqu</em>) as soon as <strong>A</strong> sealed the document for the release (<em>ṭuppi mār ban&ucirc;ti</em>), and he did not give to his previous owner the due payment for food (<em>ipru</em>), ointment (<em>pi&scaron;&scaron;atu</em>) and clothing (<em>lubu&scaron;tu</em>). <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>, <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s wife, respected (<em>palāhu</em>), looked after (<em>adāru</em>) and cared for (<em>suddudu</em>) <strong>A</strong> (her father-in-law), and she gave him food, ointment and clothing. Thus, <strong>A</strong> of his own free will (<em>ina hūd libbi&scaron;u</em>), declared null (<em>pasāsu</em>) the tablet related to <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s release and sealed (<em>kanāku</em>) this new one. In it he transmits the property (<em>dagālu</em> &Scaron;) of the fugitive slave to <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> and her daughter <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong>, who will respect (<em>palāhu</em>) him. After <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>&rsquo;s death, <strong>B </strong>will belong to <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong>. The text ends with the curse formulas addressed to whomever will change what is written in the tablet. Names of 5 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iqī&scaron;āya/Kudurru//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Rēmanni-Bēl; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ina-Esagila-rāmat/Zēria//Nabāya, wife of <strong>D</strong>; <strong>D</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Nuptāya, daughter of <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> and <strong>D</strong>"
