Interest at default.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 1/2 mina of medium quality silver with an 1/8 alloy to <strong>A</strong>, to be paid without interest at the end of Simān (III) to <strong>C</strong> in Babylon. If he fails to do so, the debt will start bearing a yearly interest of 20% to be paid on a monthly basis, namely from D&ucirc;zu (IV) onwards.
