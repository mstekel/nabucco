paraphrase: "Sale of a pledged slave.<br /> <strong>A</strong>, of his own free will, sells his slave<strong> C</strong> to <strong>B</strong>; the agreed purchase price amounts to 52 shekels of silver. <strong>A </strong>guarantees against (suits brought by) a person acting unlawfully (<em>sēh&ucirc;</em>) or a person claiming (<em>pāqirānu</em>) that <strong>C</strong> is a free person (<em>mār ban&ecirc;</em>). The silver from this sale is used to pay off <strong>D</strong>, <strong>A</strong>&#39;s creditor, to whom the sold slave had been pledged. After having received the silver that was due to him, &nbsp;<strong>D</strong> gives <strong>B</strong> the documents pertaining to this debt. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = L&acirc;bā&scaron;i-Marduk/Nādin//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-ṣull&ecirc;-&scaron;emu; <strong>D</strong> = Mardukāya/Rēmūt-Bēl//Atkuppu"
