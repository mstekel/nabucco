paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> The tablet records the purchase of agricultural land which, given its irregular shape, is calculated according to two measured areas: each one of these plots is described separately, marked on the tablet by a line drawn at the end of each paragraph (and indicated below in the paraphrase by LINE).<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases&nbsp; 0;1 Kor (2700 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) from three members of the same family: <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, his sister <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> and his brother-in-law <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong>. It is a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>), in the meadowland (<em>ugāru</em>) at the branch of the Borsippa Canal in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon. LINE<br /> The first portion (<em>mi&scaron;īhtu</em>) measures 457 cubits (228,5 m), its upper side in the North borders on (the property of) <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>, its lower side in the South measures 450 cubits (225 m) and borders on (the property of) <strong>A</strong>, the buyer. Its upper front in the West measures 22 1/2 cubits (11,25 m) and borders on (the property of) <strong>D</strong>, its lower front in the East measures 21 cubits (10,5 m) and is adjacent to the royal street (<em>harrān &scaron;arri</em>). In total, the area of the first measured area (<em>mi&scaron;īhtu</em>) above the royal street (<em>elān harrān &scaron;arri</em>) is 0;0.5.2.7 Kor (2452,5 m<sup>2</sup>). LINE<br /> The second plot has a more regular surface: its long sides both measure 57 1/2 cubits (28,75 m) &ndash; the one in the North borders on (the property of) <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> and the one in the South on (the property of) <strong>A</strong>; its upper front in the West is 21 1/2 cubits (10,75 m) long and borders on the royal street (<em>harrān &scaron;arri</em>) and the lower front in the East is adjacent to the marshes (<em>raqqatu</em>) on the bank of the Euphrates (<em>ki&scaron;ād nār Puratti</em>). The total surface of this measured area (<em>mi&scaron;īhtu</em>), which is below the royal street (<em>&scaron;ap</em><em>lān harrān &scaron;arri</em>), is 0;0.0.3.3 Kor (247,5 m<sup>2</sup>). LINE<br /> In total, thus, <strong>A</strong> purchases 0;1 Kor (2700 m<sup>2</sup>) of land from <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, his sister <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> and his brother-in-law <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong>. The buyer declares the equivalent for this land together with the sellers (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>) to be 1 shekel of silver for each 3 3/4 gar (28,1 m<sup>2</sup>) of land. <strong>A</strong> pays (<em>nadānu</em>) them 1 mina and 36 shekels of silver for the total price (<em>&scaron;īmi&scaron;u gamrūtu</em>) of this field, plus 6 1/2 shekels of silver as additional payment (<em>k&icirc; p&icirc; atra</em>). <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> acknowledge that they have received (<em>mahāru</em>) in total 1 mina and 42 1/2 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), and&nbsp; they are satisfied (<em>aplū</em>). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. Names of 6 witnesses (including <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong>, mother of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong>) and 2 scribes.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Marduk-&scaron;umu-iddin/Nab&ucirc;-udammiq//I&scaron;pāru; <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Qudā&scaron;u/Nab&ucirc;-udammiq//I&scaron;pāru, sister of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Kudurru//I&scaron;pāru, brother-in-law of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl/Esagil-zēri//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bān-zēri/Nā&#39;id-Marduk//I&scaron;pāru; <strong>D</strong> = Marduk-&scaron;umu-iddin/&Scaron;ākin-&scaron;umi//Malahu; <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong> = Ramūa/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-iddin/S&icirc;n-tabni"
