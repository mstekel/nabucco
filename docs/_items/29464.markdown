paraphrase: "Settlement of accounts.<br /> The tablet records the settlement of accounts (<em>epu&scaron; nikkassi</em>) between <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, in particular the payment for the work of forced labourer(s) (<em>urā&scaron;u</em>) from the&nbsp; 1<sup>st</sup> of Abu (V) of Cyrus&rsquo; 3<sup>rd</sup> regnal year to the end of Simān (III) of the following year. <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s debt towards <strong>B</strong> is finished (<em>qat&ucirc;</em>), they no more owe silver to each other. The text, however, also points out that another settlement of accounts (<em>epu&scaron; nikkassi</em>) between the two is still not solved (<em>ul</em> <em>qat&ucirc;</em>): this debt is related to a period from Addar (XII) of the king&rsquo;s 2<sup>nd</sup> regnal year to D&ucirc;zu (IV) of the following year. The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Marduk-rēmanni/Nab&ucirc;-zēru-iqī&scaron;a//(E)san<em>gilia</em>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya; <strong>B</strong> = Bāni-zēri/Dayyān-Marduk"
