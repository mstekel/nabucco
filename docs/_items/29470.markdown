paraphrase: "Promissory note for dates. Tax-related. Fragmentary.<br /> <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> owe 33 kor of dates to <strong>A</strong> in return for a payment (<em>&scaron;īmu</em>) that <strong>A</strong> made (<em>nadānu</em> G Stat.) on their behalf (<em>ana muhhi</em>) to the palace for the [x]-me (= a tax?) of Cambyses&#39; 4th year.. In addition, there is an earlier claim (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) for silver between the same parties that is still pending. From this point onwards the document is very fragmentarily preserved: [(...)] silver to/for (?) [&hellip;], which <strong>C</strong> (?), the deputy (<em>&scaron;an&ucirc;</em>), [&hellip;] for the credit of the mentioned silver in Ta&scaron;rīt(VII) of Cambyses&rsquo; 5<sup>th</sup> year, [&hellip;] the dates [&hellip;] he will deliver/pay. The debtors assume warranty for each other. A short remark at the very end of the document points out that excluded from the above (<em>u elat</em><sup>!</sup>) is also the silver that was given (<em>nadānu</em> G Stat.) to <strong>D</strong> and <strong>E</strong>. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Nidinti-Bēl/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-uballiṭ.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir-nap&scaron;āti/Ibnāya; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = &Scaron;umu-iddin/Nab&ucirc;-ahu-uṣur family name not certain; <strong>C</strong> = Ahu-lī&scaron;ir(?); <strong>D</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-iddin; <strong>E</strong> = Nergal-ana-bīti&scaron;u /Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;allim//Dēk&ucirc;"
