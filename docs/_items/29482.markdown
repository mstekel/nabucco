paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Subrogation.<br /> Concerns the debt for 4 1/3&nbsp; minas of silver that <strong>B</strong> owes to <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> and for which a promissory note has been issued in her name (ana &scaron;umi) against <strong>B</strong> (<em>e&rsquo;ēlu</em>). <strong>C</strong> , the creditor&#39;s son-in-law, undertakes to give back the promissory note to the debtor upon repayment of the debt (<em>t&acirc;ru</em> D-<em>nadānu</em>). Apparently, the title to the debt had been transferred to him, and together with it also the pertinent document(s). Each of the parties receive one copy of the present document. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu/Marduk-&scaron;umu-uṣur//Nappāhu.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ina-Esagila-rāmat/Zēria//Nabāya; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-erība/Pir&#39;u//Ir&rsquo;anni;&nbsp; <strong>C</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi"
