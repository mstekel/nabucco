paraphrase: "Division of inheritance.<br /> The top part of the tablet is lost, when the text resumes, one can deduce that<strong> A</strong> (whose name is lost) receives (<em>mahāru</em>) something from <strong>B</strong>. Then, the text continues listing the division of the inheritance: <strong>C</strong> receives from <strong>B</strong> (<em>ina qātē </em><strong>B</strong> <em>eṭēru </em>N) the land of the business partnership (<em>harrānu</em>), which he holds jointly with <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s sons and that is located at the opening (<em>bitqu</em>) of the Ile&rsquo;&rsquo;i-Bēl canal. <strong>C</strong> acknowledges that he is satisfied (<em>apālu</em>&nbsp; G Stat) with his share, amounting to a one-fourth share in the inheritance; the parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each others. In the final (fragmentary) part of the document it is stated that a female slave, <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong>, remains their commonly held property (<em>kar&ucirc;</em>). Names of 1+ witnesses; name of the scribe broken off.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = broken name; <strong>B</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Nergal-ēṭir (without affiliation, probably B&rsquo;s brother); <strong>D</strong> = Rēmūtu/Kurbanni-Marduk//Eppe&scaron;-ilī; <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Lētka-id&icirc;-Zarpanītu"
