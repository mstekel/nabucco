paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> Fragment of a tablet recording the purchase of land. One can recognize the names of the buyer <strong>A </strong>and the seller <strong>B</strong>; the presence of the expression &ldquo;to compensate each other&rdquo; (<em>ahāmi&scaron; apālu </em>) suggests that the few words that are extant refer to the measurement of the field that will take place after the exchange of silver between the two parties.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Balāṭu/&hellip;"
