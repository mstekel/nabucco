paraphrase: "About the purchase of a field.<br /> <strong>A</strong>, acting as a proxy, purchases 0;0.2.2 kor (1050 m<sup>2</sup>) of arable land (<em>zēru</em>) for 56 shekels of white silver from <strong>B</strong>. The field is an orchard (<em>kir&ucirc;</em>) planted with date palms (<em>gi&scaron;immarē zaqpu</em>), situated in the open country (<em>ṣēru</em>), in front of (<em>meḫratu</em>) the Ura&scaron; Gate in the district (<em>pīḫatu</em>) of Babylon. The document is written at <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s request (<em>ana ṣib&ucirc;ti</em>), whose silver has been used for the purchase and establishes that <strong>A</strong>, his intermediary, has no share in this field. Names of 8 witnesses and the scribe. The scribe is the proxy himself: Arad-Bāba/ Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk//A&scaron;lāku.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Arad-Bāba/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk//A&scaron;lāku; <strong>B</strong> = Nergal-u&scaron;ezib/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi"
