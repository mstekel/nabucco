paraphrase: "House rental.<br /> <strong>A</strong> rents a house to <strong>B</strong> for 10 shekels of silver per year. The location of the house is not specified. It is agreed that half of the silver should be paid at the beginning of the year, and the remainder in the middle. The renter should caulk (<em>&scaron;an&ucirc;</em>) the roof and repair the wall foundations (<em>asurr&ucirc;</em>). He should also pay for the additional payment (<em>nūptu</em>) in Nisan (I), D&ucirc;zu (IV) and Kislim (IX). The house will be at his disposal from the 1<sup>st </sup>of D&ucirc;zu (IV) onwards, i.e. next month. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-apli/Ibnāya//Ir&rsquo;anni"
