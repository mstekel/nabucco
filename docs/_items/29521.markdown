paraphrase: "Interim settlement of accounts within the framework of a business partnership (harranu);<br /> <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> make an interim account of the expenses that they had while running the business they set up together. First, <strong>A</strong> transferred (<em>nasāhu</em>)&nbsp; 1 mina and 30 shekels of silver from (<em>ultu</em>) the business accounts to <strong>B</strong> (<em>ina muhhi</em>) for the following expenses:&nbsp; 30 shekels were put at <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s disposal; 20 shekels were used to purchase (<em>abāku</em>)&nbsp; <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong> from <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>, and 40 shekels of silver were (withdrawn) from&nbsp; (<em>ultu</em>) the business account. So, <strong>B </strong>withdrew (<em>nasāhu</em>)&nbsp; in total 1 mina and 30 shekels from the business account before <strong>A</strong> (<em>ana tarṣi</em>). Secondly, <strong>A</strong> transferred 1 mina 7 &frac12; shekels of silver for the purchase of <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong> from <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> to (<em>ana</em>) the business account. As for the two slaves that were thus purchased:<strong> <sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub></strong> belongs to <strong>B</strong> and <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong> belongs to <strong>A</strong>. The amounts that they thus transferred from (and to) the business account (<em>nishētu</em>) are acceptable amounts (<em>muqutt&ucirc;</em>). None of the partners exceeded (<em>etēqu</em>) the allowed amount (<em>manma ina muhhi manma ul etiq</em>, lit. &ldquo;one party did not exceed as against the other&rdquo;). Finally, with respect to the &frac12; mina of silver which <strong>A</strong> withdrew from the business account (<em>ultu nasāhu</em>) (and) lent out (<em>u&rsquo;iltu &scaron;a <strong>A</strong></em>, lit. the promissory note credited to <strong>A</strong>), and the 1 mina of silver that he lent to <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong>: <strong>A</strong> has debited (<em>nadānu</em>) these amounts from his own assets (<em>ramānu</em>). Names of 3 witnesses, and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl&scaron;unu/Bēl-ahhē-iddin//S&icirc;n-imitti; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Kidin-Marduk/Ina-Esagil-zēri//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bēl-ahhē-iddin/Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-apli//Būṣu; <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong> = Mu&scaron;ēb&scaron;i/Qī&scaron;ti-Marduk; <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Silīm-I&scaron;tar, a female slave of <strong>C<sub>2</sub>; </strong><strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bēl-attā-tale&rsquo;&rsquo;i, a slave of<strong> C<sub>2</sub></strong>"
