paraphrase: "Sale of a slave to finalise a previous unfinished deal.<br /> <strong>A</strong>, of his own free will, sells his female slave <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> to <strong>B</strong> for a <em>hariṣ </em>purchase price amounting to 2/3 mina of silver. <strong>A </strong>guarantees against (suits brought by) a person acting unlawfully (<em>sēh&ucirc;</em>) or a person claiming (<em>pāqirānu</em>) that <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>C</strong> is a palace slave (<em>amat ekalli</em>) or a free person (<em>mār ban&ecirc;</em>).&nbsp; In the purchase price is included 1 mina of silver from the price of a plot of land located on the Zabūnu ditch: <strong>B</strong> paid this silver to <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub></strong> and her son <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong>, but then he never finalised the purchase of the land (cf. BM30600; see also BM30911). Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-&scaron;umu-ibni/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-ukīn//Ile&rsquo;&rsquo;i-bulliṭ-Marduk; <strong>B</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = <sup>f</sup>&Scaron;idatu; <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ka&scaron;&scaron;āya/&Scaron;ulāya//Nanna-utu; <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong> = Marduk-&scaron;umu-ibni/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu"
