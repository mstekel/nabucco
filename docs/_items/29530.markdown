paraphrase: "Oath<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and his son <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> swear to <strong>B</strong> by the gods and the king that on a specific day (the number is lost in a lacuna) of &Scaron;abāṭ (XI) of Darius&rsquo; 14th regnal year they will bring along (<em>abāku</em>) (to <strong>B</strong>) 2 [...],1 red draft ox (<em>&scaron;addidu</em>) and a young cow, in total 4 bovines, that <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> sold (<em>ana kaspi nadānu</em>) to <strong>B</strong> and that the seller and his father previously brought along (<em>abāku</em>) in front of <strong>C</strong>, <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s slave (<em>qallu</em>). <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> will also give to the buyer the tablet (<em>imm&ucirc;</em>) (related to this purchase). <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> will show (<em>kalāmu</em> D) the promissory note (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) for a cow and its calf to <strong>B</strong>, and he will bring along (<em>abāku</em>) the animals: should he fail to return and present (<em>t&acirc;ru-nadānu</em>) them, then <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> will give 200 kor (c. 36000 l) of dates and 30 kor (c. 5400 l) of barley to <strong>B</strong>. This is what remains (<em>rīhtu</em>) to be paid from a promissory note (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) for an amount of 110 kor (c. 19800 l) of barley and 200 kor (c. 36000 l) of dates. <strong>D</strong> guarantees for <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>, with regards to the delivery of the mentioned bovines. A note written at the end of the document points out that the agreement recorded in this tablet does not include (<em>elat</em>) another claim (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) charged against <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong><em>. </em>Names of 7 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-zēru-ibni/A&scaron;&scaron;ur-abu-uṣur; <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = Iqī&scaron;a-Marduk/Nab&ucirc;-zēru-ibni; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = &Scaron;ēpēt-Bēl-aṣbat, slave of B; <strong>D</strong> = Bēl-ēdu-pitni/Balāṭu"
