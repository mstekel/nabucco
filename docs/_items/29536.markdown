paraphrase: "Land rental.<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub> </strong>rents land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>) and a grain field (<em>p&icirc; &scaron;ulpu</em>), located at the branch of the ancient Kutha Canal near (the property of) the sons of [PN] and <strong>C</strong>, to <strong>B</strong>, who should perform gardening work (<em>nukaribbūtu</em>). The landlord owns it together with his brothers and <strong>A<sub>2.</sub></strong> The renter should dig (verb broken off) a ditch 0;0.2 r (3,5 m<sup>2</sup>) deep and build a dam (musannitu). He should also build (<em>aṣ&ucirc; </em>&Scaron;) 2 drainage canals (<em>āṣītu</em>), one above and one below the ditch. For the entire field, newly cleared as well as cultivated land (<em>tapt&ucirc; u bīt dulli</em>), <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> will give to <strong>B</strong> as follows: 6 kor (1080 l) of dates per kor of newly cleared land (<em>tapt&ucirc;</em>), and 5 kor (900 l) of dates per kor of cultivated land (<em>bīt dulli</em>) &ndash; as long as the renter finishes the entire digging work (<em>her&ucirc;-ma qat&ucirc;</em>). Should <strong>B</strong> be negligent in his work, then he will pay to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> 5 Kor (900 l) of dates per kor of land under his responsibility. The field is at the renter&rsquo;s disposal for 5 years. As for the arable land that he will farm, <strong>B</strong> will pay a quarter of the <em>&scaron;ib&scaron;u</em>-tax to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>.&nbsp; Whoever breaks the contract shall pay 1 mina of silver. Names of 8 witnesses and a slave.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bēl-uballiṭ/Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu//Bēl- ēṭir; <strong>B</strong> = Aplāya/Iqī&scaron;a-Marduk//Suhāya; <strong>C</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu"
