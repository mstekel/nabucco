paraphrase: "Court protocol. Fragmentary.<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> said thus to the judges of Nabonidus: &quot;In Neriglissar&rsquo;s 2<sup>nd</sup> regnal year, our mother <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> has handed over (<em>dagālu </em>&Scaron;) to us [&hellip;] and <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>, a slave who was part of her dowry (<em>ardu &scaron;a nudunn&ecirc;</em>), by means of a sealed document. One year later, of her own free will (<em>ina migir libbi&scaron;u</em>), she has also (given to us?) 2;2 square kor (c. 32400 m<sup>2</sup>) of land which the royal scribes had transferred to her (<em>dagālu </em>&Scaron;) as countervalue of her dowry (<em>kūm nudunn&ecirc;</em>). They wrote in her document: &lsquo;Whoever among her sons will not respect (<em>palāhu</em>) her, will not receive his inheritance share&rsquo;. [&hellip;] <strong>D </strong>[&hellip;]&rdquo;. The final lines of the two sons&rsquo; speech is lost, as well as the following section of the text which must have included the judgement. The few words that are extant mention a purchase price (<em>&scaron;īmu</em>), a sealed document written by <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong>, something that is registered (<em>uzuzzu </em>&Scaron;) on tablets, as well as the receiving of the judges&rsquo; verdict (<em>dīnu</em>). After another mention of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>&rsquo;s names, the text breaks off. Names of 5 judges and 2 scribes.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = broken off; <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bēl-uballiṭ/&Scaron;umu-ukīn//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu; <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Kurunnam-tabni, mother of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = broken off, slave of <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong>; <strong>D</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl"
