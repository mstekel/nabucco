paraphrase: "Establishment of a business partnership.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 1/3 minas(*) of silver to <strong>A</strong>, his business partner. The background to this debt is the subsidiary partnership (<em>harrānu</em>) contracted by<strong> A</strong> (investor) with<strong> B</strong> (acting partner) and financed by assets drawn from the parent partnership (<em>harrānu</em>) between<strong> C</strong> (investor) and <strong>A</strong> (acting partner). <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> agreed that the latter will run the business (<em>na&scaron;partu &scaron;a harrāni alāku</em>), but that both partners share equally (<em>ahi </em>... <em>akālu</em>) in the profits (<em>utru</em>). <strong>B</strong> is not entitled to profit from any other investments of the partnership between <strong>C </strong>and <strong>A</strong>, only from the enterprise for which he is commissioned (<em>mimma elat &scaron;a</em> <strong>B</strong> <em>ianu</em>). He should not spend more (<em>etēqu</em>) than one shekel (on travel expenses) and cover any excesses from his own account. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Nab&ucirc;-aplu-iddin/Ṭabiya//Suhāya.<br /> (*) Text: 1/3 shekels.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Rēmūtu (Rēmūtu/Kurbanni-Marduk//Eppe&scaron;-ilī); <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-iddin (Bēl-iddin/Nergal-uballiṭ//A&scaron;kāpu); <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi"
