Some elements in the description of this plot of land is still unclear. <strong>B</strong> grants (<em>&scaron;em&ucirc;</em>) <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s request: he gives him a plot of land whose short side measures 800 cubits (c. 400 m), located on the bank of the Harru-Canal. The plot stretches from the border with X till the border of Y (their names cannot be read), and it is given for an unlimited period of time (<em>ana ūmī ṣ&acirc;ti</em>); he will enjoy (<em>akālu</em>) a half share (<em>ahi zitti</em>)? The remaining of the text is very fragmentary. Names of 6 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = &Scaron;ulāya/Nab&ucirc;-zēru-ukīn//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Hahhuru/ Nadnāya, <em>qallu</em>; <strong>C</strong> = Zēria, governor (<em>bēl pihāti</em>) [&hellip;]"
