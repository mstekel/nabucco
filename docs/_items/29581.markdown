paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> The tablet records the purchase of agricultural land; the text has been divided into paragraphs, marked on the tablet by a line drawn at the end of each one (and indicated below in the paraphrase by LINE).<br /> <strong>A </strong>purchases agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>), consisting of two plots, from <strong>B</strong>: the first one consists of 0;2 Kor (5400 m<sup>2</sup>) of land in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>), a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) bearing fruit (<em>iṣṣi bilti</em>) and the second one consists of 0;3.2 Kor (9000 m<sup>2</sup>) of cultivated land (<em>mēre&scaron;u</em>) in Litamu in front of the Ura&scaron; Gate, in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon. LINE<br /> The upper side in the North of this land borders on (the properties of) <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>, its lower side in the South on (the property of) <strong>D</strong>; its upper front in the West is adjacent to the bank (<em>ki&scaron;ādu</em>) of the Piqūdu Canal and its lower front in the East is adjacent to the lower end (<em>&scaron;ēpītu</em>) of the 5000 field complex.<br /> In total, the land measures 1;0.2 Kor (14400 m<sup>2</sup>) &ndash; of which 0;2 Kor (5400 m<sup>2</sup>) are land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>). LINE<br /> <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent for this land together with the seller <strong>B</strong> (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>): the orchard is valued (<em>&scaron;uqultu</em>) at 3 minas and 12 shekels, and the land cultivated with grain at&nbsp; 46 2/3 shekels. The buyer gives (<em>nadānu</em>) 3 minas and 58 2/3 shekels of silver as total price (<em>&scaron;īmi&scaron;u gamrūtu</em>) of this field, plus 4 shekels of silver as additional payment (<em>k&icirc; atri</em>). LINE<br /> <strong>B</strong> acknowledges that he has received (<em>mahāru</em>) in total 4 minas and 2 2/3 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), and he is satisfied (<em>apālu</em> G Stat). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. The field will then be measured: should it be found smaller or larger than what was originally calculated they will compensate each other (<em>ahāmi&scaron; apālu</em>) according to the field-price ratio (<em>mahīru</em>) they agreed upon.
