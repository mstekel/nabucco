paraphrase: "Pledge of housewith anitchresis as security for a silver debt.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 4 &frac12; minas of medium quality silver, of which one-eighth is alloy to <strong>A</strong>. The payment is secured by the pledge of the debtor&rsquo;s house located in the Mu&scaron;ēpi&scaron;u-&scaron;a-hubur street, next to the houses of <strong>C</strong> and <strong>D</strong>. The creditor enjoys the usufruct of the house in lieu of receiving interest (antichresis). Accordingly, he does not pay rent for the house, and <strong>B</strong> does not pay interest on his debt until the capital amount, 4 &frac12; minas of silver has been fully repaid (eṭēru N). The debtor&rsquo;s house is placed at the creditor&rsquo;s disposal starting from the 1st of Nisan (I) of the 19th year, i.e. in roughly three weeks from this document&#39;s date of issue. Names of 14(?) witnesses and the scribe: Nidinti-Marduk/Bēl-kāṣir.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nergal-u&scaron;allim/balāṭu//Ir&rsquo;anni; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Nidintu/Iddināya; <strong>D</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ittannu"
