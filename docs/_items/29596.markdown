paraphrase: "Addendum to the purchase of a house by proxy<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchased a 5 gi (c. 45 m<sup>2</sup>) big house and a share (<em>ahu</em>) in a slave (<strong>C</strong>) from <strong>B</strong> by proxy. He gave <strong>D</strong>, his proxy, the silver to buy the property: 2 5/6 minas of medium-quality silver of which 1/8 is alloy. The latter received (<em>mahāru</em>) the purchased property from the seller and a sale document (<em>&scaron;aṭāru</em>) was written at <strong>A</strong>&#39;s request (<em>ṣib&ucirc;tu</em>). The present document aims pointing out that <strong>D </strong>has no share (<em>zittu</em>) whatsoever in either the house or the slave. Names of 7 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nergal-u&scaron;ēzib/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>C </strong>= Bēl-&scaron;ubat-..., slave of B; <strong>D </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ittannu/Ardia//S&icirc;n-ilī"
