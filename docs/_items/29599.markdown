paraphrase: "Statement in court about testimony by a witness.<br /> On the 5th of Kislīm (IX), <strong>A</strong> will bring his witness to Piqūdu to let him testify against <strong>B</strong>, who maintains that the plaintiff should not argue a case (<em>dabābu</em>) against him about the dead slave (<em>qallu</em>), since he is ready to&nbsp; compensate him in full for the life of his slave. Should the witness testify against <strong>B</strong>, then<strong> B</strong> will pay 1 mina of silver corresponding to the purchase price for <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s slave. Should the witness not testify, [<strong>B </strong>will go unpunished]. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = &Scaron;arru-ukīn/Ammānu; <strong>B</strong> = Id&icirc;-ilī/Dīnāya"
