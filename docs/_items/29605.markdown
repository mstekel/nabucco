paraphrase: "Receipt of payment of a silver debt. Subrogation.<br /> Concerns the debt for 3 minas of silver that <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> owe to <strong>A</strong> and for which a promissory note has been issued (<em>e&rsquo;ēlu</em>). <strong>A</strong> receives payment (<em>eṭēru</em>) for this debt from <strong>C </strong>(his father-in-law). He should compel the debtors to pay (<em>lapāni na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>, lit. &quot;to take from&quot;), and give the silver to <strong>C</strong> (<em>nadānu</em>) in good conscience (<em>ina amāti</em>, lit. &quot;on the word of&quot;).&nbsp; He guarantees the collection of the said sum of silver (<em>&scaron;ipir &scaron;a kaspa</em>, lit. &ldquo;doing of this sum of silver&rdquo;). In addition, there is an earlier promissory note which is still pending. Names of xxx witnesses and the scribe<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Rēmūt/Sallana; <strong>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Gūzānu/Sūqāya; <strong>C </strong>= Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n"
