paraphrase: "Dissolution of a business partnership. Division of the profits.<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub> </strong>and <strong>B<sub>1</sub> </strong>were partners in a business venture (<em>harrānu &scaron;akānu</em>) in which they had equal shares (<em>ahi zittu</em>). Their sons (<strong>A<sub>2</sub> </strong>and<strong> B<sub>2</sub></strong>) divide (<em>z&acirc;zu</em> D) among them the arable land (<em>zēru</em>) that belongs to the partnership. The details of the division are broken off. The partners to the contract have taken a copy of the document each.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin; &nbsp;<strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Rēmūt/Kurbanni-Marduk//Eppe&scaron;-ilī; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-mu&scaron;ētiq-udd&ecirc;/Rēmūt"
