paraphrase: "Division of inheritance.<br /> The tablet records a division of inheritance among members of the I&scaron;paru family.<br /> <strong>A </strong>takes possession (<em>ṣabātu</em>) of a property whose details are largely lost in the initial lacuna. His younger brothers <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> take possession (<em>ṣabātu</em>) of x+1/2 square cubits of a surface area which is located near <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s property. Then, the text lists the agreement related to the settlements (<em>ālu</em>) that are located on the inherited land: <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> owns (<em>dagālu</em>) the houses in which <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong> live, according to his share (<em>kūm zittī&scaron;u</em>). <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> owns (<em>dagālu</em>) the house in which <strong>A</strong> lives, according to his share (<em>kūm zittī&scaron;u</em>). Each one of them will pay (lit. &ldquo;give&rdquo;, <em>nadānu</em>) for the maintenance costs (<em>kurummatu</em>) of their mother <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong>, according to her share (<em>ak&icirc; zittī&scaron;u</em>). <strong><sup>f</sup>F</strong>, a female slave, belongs to (<em>dagālu </em>N) the older brother <strong>A</strong>, according to his share (<em>kūm zittī&scaron;u</em>). <strong>G </strong>belongs to the younger brothers <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, according to their share (<em>kūm zittī&scaron;unu</em>). After the real estate and slaves, the document records shares related to a prebend, but due to the synthetical nature of the text it is not possible to infer to which specific prebendary activity it refers. It is stated that <strong>A</strong> owns (<em>dagālu</em>) one half day &ldquo;of Sippar&rdquo;, while the two younger brothers <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> own (<em>dagālu</em>) the other half. All the brothers will pay in full (<em>eṭēru</em> D), in equal amounts (<em>ahātu</em>), for the <em>nishu</em>-expenses (<em>nishu</em>) and credits (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) owed by their father; they will also share equally in their father&rsquo;s <em>nishu-</em>income that is still outstanding (<em>sūqu</em>, lit. &quot;in the market&quot;). The two younger sons are entitled to equal shares (<em>ahātu</em>) in arable land (<em>zēru</em>), whose details are not clear (wr. 3(PI)<sup>?</sup> TUK<sup>?</sup>-<em>i&aacute;</em>) and that is (possibly) adjacent to <strong>H</strong>&rsquo;s property. Each one takes possession (<em>arādu</em>, see CAD A/2 s.v. A 1a 10&rsquo;) of the front side of their shares (of land), going down until the dam (<em>makall&ucirc;</em>) of the <em>han&scaron;&ucirc;</em>-land. The text ends invoking a curse on whoever will change the words written in the document. Names of 5 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Rēmūt-Gula/Etellu//I&scaron;pāru; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir-nap&scaron;āti/Etellu//I&scaron;pāru, brother of <strong>A</strong>; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Etellu//I&scaron;pāru, brother of <strong>A</strong>; <strong>C</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Kudurru//I&scaron;pāru; <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> = Madān-ahu-iddin; <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong> = &Scaron;ama&scaron;-uballiṭ; <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Karibtu, mother of <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>; <strong><sup>f</sup>F</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Bazītu, slave of <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong>; <strong>G</strong> = Libluṭ; <strong>H</strong> = Nā&#39;id-Marduk"
