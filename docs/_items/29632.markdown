paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases land located in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon from <strong>B</strong>. Some details about the field are lost in a lacuna at the beginning of the tablet, but not those about its size and the bordering properties. Its upper side in the North measures 720 cubits (360 m) and borders on <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s land; its lower side in the South has the same length and borders on <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s land. The upper front in the West measures 49,50 cubits (24,75 m) and is adjacent to the upper irrigation canal (<em>harru el&ucirc;</em>) while its lower front in the East, that has the same length, borders on the royal street (<em>harrān &scaron;arri</em>).<br /> The buyer has declared the equivalent of the field (<em>mahīra nab&ucirc;</em>) to be 1 mina of silver and has given to <strong>B</strong>, the seller, the total price (<em>&scaron;īmi&scaron;u gamrūtu</em>) plus 3 shekels of silver as additional payment (<em>&scaron;a k&icirc; p&icirc; atri</em>). In total, <strong>B </strong>receives (<em>mahāru</em>) 1 mina and 3 shekels of silver from <strong>A</strong> as purchase price of his field (<em>eqlu</em>). The seller is satisfied (<em>apālu </em>G Stat) and the two parties agree that in future times there will no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families.<br /> In Kislīm (IX),<strong> B </strong>will bring the original document attesting the purchase (<em>ummi eqli</em>, lit. &ldquo;mother of the field&rdquo;) and hand it over to <strong>A </strong>(<em>na&scaron;āmu-nadānu</em>), who will give him 1/3 shekels of silver in return. After this clause the tablet breaks: the names of the witnesses and the scribe are lost.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Kidin-Marduk/Zēria//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Gula; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun/Tabnēa//Ah-bāni; <strong>C</strong> = Nā&#39;id-Marduk; <strong>D</strong> = Marduk-&scaron;umu-iddin/Zēria//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Gula"
