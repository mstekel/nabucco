paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> The tablet records the purchase of agricultural land; the text has been divided into paragraphs, marked on the tablet by a line drawn at the end of each one (and indicated below in the paraphrase by LINE).<br /> The first lines of the tablet are damaged, thus several details about the type and size of the land which <strong>A</strong> purchased from <strong>B<sub>1</sub> </strong>and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> are lost: from what is extant onegathers that it is located in front of the Ura&scaron; Gate in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon. LINE<br /> The upper side in the North borders on (the property of) <strong>C</strong> and the lower side in the South on (the properties of) <strong>A</strong>, the buyer as well as the one of the two brothers <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong>; the upper front in the West borders on (the property of) the brothers <strong>E<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>E<sub>2</sub></strong>. Details for the lower front in the East are lost. <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent for this land together with the sellers <strong>B<sub>1</sub> </strong>and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>) to be 1 shekel of silver for each 0;0.0.1 Kor (75 m<sup>2</sup>) of land. The total price and the amount of silver given as additional payment are lost in a lacuna of the tablet.<br /> <strong>B<sub>1</sub> </strong>and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> acknowledge that they have received (<em>mahāru, </em>wr. <em>ma-ha-ar</em>) the amount of silver corresponding to the entire purchase price of their field, and they are satisfied (<em>apālu </em>G Stat<em>, </em>wr. <em>a-pa-a)</em>. Only the first words of the usual formula that&nbsp; protects the parties against future claims or suits are extant &ndash; then, the tablet breaks. The names of the witnesses and of the scribe are lost.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēre&scaron;(?); <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = &Scaron;āpik-zēri; <strong>C</strong> = Marduk-zēru-ibni/Nab&ucirc;-balāssu-iqbi//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu; <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> = Rēmūtu/Nādinu//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu; <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bēl-iddin/Nādinu//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu; <strong>E<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-apli/Nādin-ahi; <strong>E<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bēl&scaron;unu/Nādin-ahi"
