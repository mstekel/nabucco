The house is located in Hursagkalamma in Ki&scaron;, near <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong>, by the narrow street (<em>sūqu qatnu</em>). For now, the buyer pays 50 shekels of silver, inclusive of 5 shekels of additional payment (<em>atru</em>) and <em>lubāru</em>-garments. When the receipt for payment in full (<em>ṭuppi apilti</em>) will be sealed, he will pay the rest.
