paraphrase: "House rental.<br /> <strong>A</strong> rents a house located in Borsippa near <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s house to <strong>B</strong>, at a yearly price of 1/2 mina of stamped silver (<em>ginnu</em>). The renter should caulk (<em>&scaron;an&ucirc;</em>) the roof and repair the wall foundations (<em>asurr&ucirc;</em>). He should pay for the additional payment (<em>nūptu</em>) in Nisan (I), D&ucirc;zu (IV) and Kislim (IX); it is also agreed that half of the silver should be paid at the beginning of the year, and the remainder in the middle. The house is at the renter&rsquo;s disposal from the 2<sup>nd</sup> of Ayyār (II) onwards. Names of 3 wiitnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Bēl/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-iddin//&Scaron;ama&scaron;-bari; <strong>C</strong> = Bulṭāya"
