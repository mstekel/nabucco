paraphrase: "Division of shares in a business company and interim account of its assets.<br /> <strong>A</strong> , his brothers and <strong>B</strong> divide among them the arable land planted with date palms and cultivated with grain located at the outlet (<em>bābu</em>) of Borsippa canal next to [PN and PN]. <strong>A </strong>and his brothers will get 1 kor, and B will get 1 kor. The attribution of the shares (<em>zittu ṣabātu</em>) will be decided by casting lots (<em>pūru maqātu</em>, lit. (where) the lot falls&rdquo;). Also the slaves will be divided in this way: <strong>C </strong>and<strong><sup> f</sup>D</strong> at the first casting, and <strong>E</strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>F</strong> and the second. Certain assets will not be divide but remain in the business account: it concerns the female slave <strong><sup>f</sup>G</strong> , 25 shekels, and the silver needed to purchase 4 slaves from <strong>H. </strong>The same is true for the following assets: 200 vats filled with first quality (<em>rē&scaron;tu) </em>and full-strength beer (<em>ṭābu</em>), 20 empty vats, 10 fermenting vats (<em>namzītu</em>) with stands (<em>namharu</em>), 90 kor of dates still at the depot (<em>kalakku</em>),&nbsp; 15 kor of sifted (<em>nahlutu</em>) mustard-seeds, and 14 animals from the flock (<em>ṣēnu</em>) . Excluded from the above (<em>elat</em>) are: still outstanding credits or claims (lit. &ldquo;promissory notes of the street&rdquo;, <em>sūqu)</em>, and everything that <strong>B</strong> plans to undertake (<em>hasāsu</em>). In order to avoid any further changes in the above agreement, each of the partners has taken a copy of the present document. Names of 5 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl&scaron;unu/Bēl-ahhē-iddin//S&icirc;n-imitti; <strong>C</strong> = Lūṣi-ana-nūri; <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Le&rsquo;&rsquo;itu; <strong>E</strong> = Nergal-dānu; <strong><sup>f</sup>F</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Immirtu; <strong><sup>f</sup>G</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ninlil-silīm; <strong>H</strong> = Marduk-&scaron;āpik-zēri"
