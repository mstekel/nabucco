paraphrase: "Land rental.<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> rents a field which belongs to his wife <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>2</sub></strong> for 5 years to <strong>B</strong>. The land is planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>), located in Litamu, from the bank (<em>ki&scaron;ādu</em>) of the Piqūdu Canal to the (property of) <strong>C</strong>, and it borders on (the properties of) <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong> and of <strong>E</strong>&rsquo;s sons. The central part of the text is fragmentary: from what is extant, one infers that the renter shall dig a ditch and that he will receive the gardener&#39;s remuneration (<em>&scaron;issinnu</em>). Likely the text included provisions related to irrigation duties. When the text resumes, the gardener&#39;s remuneration (<em>&scaron;issinnu</em>) is mentioned again: <strong>B</strong> will receive 5 kor (900 l) of dates per kor of land. As long as he will hoe (<em>dek&ucirc;</em>) the soil with the plow (<em>epinnu</em>), loosen it (<em>pa&scaron;aru</em>) and break up <em>the clods</em>(?) (<em>&scaron;etirtu</em>), he will receive 4 kor (720 l) of dates as gardener&#39;s remuneration (<em>&scaron;issinnu</em>). Whoever breaks the contract shall pay 1 mina of silver. Along the years, the renter will finish the entire digging work (<em>her&ucirc;-ma qat&ucirc;</em>); he has at his disposal 1 shovel (<em>marru</em>) whose weight is 2 minas and 6 shekels. Names of 6 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Amat-Bāba/Kalbāya//Nabāya; <strong>B</strong> = Madānu-iddin; <strong>C</strong> = Kināya; <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Inba-Arad-Marduk; <strong>E</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ittannu"
