paraphrase: "Court protocol.<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>3</sub></strong>, <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s daughters, sold (<em>ana kaspi nadānu</em>) a field (<em>eqlu</em>) located in Babylon, in front of the Ura&scaron; Gate, to Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi (not explicitly mentioned in this text, but see the contract recorded in BM32674+). Now, <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, wife of <strong>C</strong> (<strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s brother) together with her son <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> bring suit concerning that field: they came in front of Nabonidus&rsquo; judges, who hear their arguments (<em>dibbu</em> <em>&scaron;em&ucirc;</em>). According to <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s testimony, <strong>C</strong> had made an agreement (<em>riksu</em>) with the three women, since there was a claim (<em>paqāru</em>) against their field. The agreement established that <strong>C </strong>would return (<em>t&acirc;ru </em>D) the field and give it to <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>E</strong>, <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s wife, and to <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>3</sub></strong>, <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s daughters. If <strong>C</strong> failed to return that field, [...] they would have received a half shekel per each shekel [...] And if 6 minas of silver, the principal amount (<em>qaqqadu</em>), [...] 1 mina and the expenses (<em>gimru</em>) [...] (This fragmentary passage must have contained a monetary penalty to be paid in case of failure to return the field). That agreement was brought in and the judges read (<em>&scaron;as&ucirc; </em>Gtn) it and they deliberated (<em>&scaron;&acirc;lu </em>Gt): [...] The final lines of the tablet are severely damaged, thus the judges&rsquo; decisions cannot be reconstructed. Only the final clause which states that there will be no more claims or suits is extant. Names of 6 judges and 2 scribes.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Nadāya/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-udammiq//Ma&scaron;tuk; <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Esagil-rāmat/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-udammiq//Ma&scaron;tuk; <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>3</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Bēlilitu/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-udammiq//Ma&scaron;tuk; <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Hibbuṣu, wife of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk son of <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>C</strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;, brother of <strong>D</strong>; <strong>D</strong> = &Scaron;ama&scaron;-udammiq; <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ta&scaron;mētu-damqat, wife of <strong>D</strong>; <strong><sup>f</sup>F<sub>1</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Nadā, daughter of <strong>D</strong>; <strong><sup>f</sup>F<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ina-Esagil-ram&acirc;t, daughter of <strong>D</strong>; <strong><sup>f</sup>F<sub>3</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Belilitu, daughter of <strong>D</strong>"
