paraphrase: "Sale of a slave through a proxy.<br /> <strong>A</strong> sells his female slave <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> together with her son to <strong>B</strong>. It is pointed out that the sale is concluded through <strong>D</strong>, who acts as proxy (<em>ina na&scaron;parti</em>) on behalf of the buyer. It is acknowledged that&nbsp; <strong>D</strong> has taken away (<em>ana kaspi abāku</em>) the slaves, whose total purchase price (<em>gamru</em>) corresponds to 5/6 mina of silver, and that he wrote a document (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) in <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s name. The silver has been given (<em>nadānu</em>) to <strong>A</strong>. Should any document related to this deal turn up in <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s house, it belongs to <strong>B</strong>. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Bēl-kāṣir/Bēl-rēmanni//Bābūtu.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-aplu-iddin/Balāṭu//&Scaron;a-nā&scaron;ī&scaron;u; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Gula-rēmanni; <strong>D</strong> = Marduk-iqī&scaron;anni/Bānia//Ilī-tillatī"
