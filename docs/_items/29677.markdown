paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Detailed arrangement for its repayment.<br /> <strong>B </strong>owes 4 shekels of silver to <strong><sup>f</sup>A </strong>and a complicated arrangement for its repayment is made against the background of the creditor&#39;s intention to buy a female slave (<strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>) from the debtor&#39;s sister <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub></strong> and niece <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>2</sub></strong> in the near future. <strong>B</strong> can deduct (<em>maqātu</em> &Scaron;) his debt of 4 shekels to<strong> <sup>f</sup>A</strong> from the slave&#39;s purchase price on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of Kislīm (IX), which is within a couple of days. However, should&nbsp; <strong><sup>f</sup>A </strong>not buy the female slave, a different procedure should be followed: <strong>B</strong> should then pay off his silver debt in dates. The exchange rate (<em>mahīru</em>) is fixed at 1 shekel per 0;0.3 kor of dates, being the exchange rate of Til-Gubbi (being 10% lower than the usual 1:1 rate)<strong>. </strong>To this he should add 0;0.4 kor of dates. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Marduk-balāssu-iqbi/Nab&ucirc;-zēru-iddin/Dābibi<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ta&scaron;mētu-damqat/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin(//Egibi); <strong>B</strong> = Gimil-Nergal/Bēl-u&scaron;allim//Abu-ul-īde; <strong><sup>f</sup>C </strong>= <sup>f</sup>Ina-ṣilli-Esabad, slave, of <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong>; <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Tappa&scaron;ra (= <sup>f</sup>Tapa&scaron;&scaron;ara), sister of<strong> B</strong>; <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>&Scaron;ikk&ucirc;, daughter of <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>1 </sub></strong>and niece of <strong>B</strong>"
