paraphrase: "Land lease agreement<br /> Concerns the arable land that the brothers <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> leased to <strong>B</strong>&#39;s disposal against the payment of a fixed rent (<em>sūtu</em>). <strong>B</strong> should cultivate (<em>erē&scaron;u</em>) the land and at harvest time, in Ayyar (II) of Darius&#39; 16th year, he can take the (entire) barley yield (<em>ebūru &scaron;a uṭṭāti</em>). After the harvest, he should release the field <em>(mu&scaron;&scaron;uru</em>) to its owners (<strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>). He is also entitled to cultivate the <em>bīt dulli</em>-field that is included in the lease agreement (<em>u&#39;iltu &scaron;a sūti</em>) but as yet uncultivated (<em>la ep&scaron;u</em>), and afterwards release it to its owners. He cannot bring suit (<em>ragāmu</em>) against <strong>B</strong> with regard to the cultivation of the arable land that was previously fallow (<em>tapt&ucirc;</em>) (and) had not been tilled prior to the conclusion of the said lease agreement. Names of 10 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-nādin-&scaron;umi und <strong>A<sub>2</sub> </strong>= Rēmūt-Bēl, sons of Erība-Marduk/Mandidi; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi"
