paraphrase: "Court protocol.<br /> <strong>A</strong> presents a complaint against <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> in front of the judges of Nabonidus. The two men claimed that they owed a debt (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) amounting to 5 minas of silver to <strong>C</strong>, for which their field near the Hazuzu ditch (<em>harru</em>) had been taken as a pledge (<em>ma&scaron;kanu ṣabātu</em>). According to them that field was then sold (<em>ana kaspi nadānu</em>) to <strong>D</strong>, <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s father, thus they demanded for 30 shekels of silver from <strong>A</strong>, in exchange for the promissory note (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) related to the first debt. <strong>A</strong>, soliciting proofs, withheld (<em>kal&ucirc;</em> D) the tablet and asked them to present <strong>C</strong>, but then <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> grabbed (<em>habātu</em>) that promissory note away from his hands and chewed it (<em>kasāsu</em>). The judges interrogated (<em>&scaron;a&rsquo;ālu</em>) <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, who maintained that the promissory note had been paid off (<em>eṭēru</em>), and that <strong>A</strong> had summoned them for no reason. The judges then asked them to present (<em>abālu</em>) <strong>C</strong>, the (alleged) creditor, but the two men did not do it and changed (<em>nakāru</em>) their declaration, saying that they did not know him. Therefore, the judges now deliberate (<em>malāku</em>): the promissory note brought by <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> turns out to be false (<em>ana surrāti</em>), and the two must pay to <strong>A </strong>10 times the 5 minas of silver of the debt that hey had falsified. Moreover, for the purpose of bringing forward (<em>abāku</em>) the scribe who wrote the false promissory note, they placed <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> him in fetters and handed them over (<em>paqādu</em>) to <strong>A</strong>. Names of 7 judges and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = &Scaron;āpik-zēri/&Scaron;umu-ukīn//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bēl-uballiṭ/&Scaron;umu-ukīn//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu; <strong>C</strong> = Rēmūtu/Ina-qibit-Nab&ucirc;; <strong>D</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi, father of <strong>A</strong>"
