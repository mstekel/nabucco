paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> The tablet records the purchase of agricultural land which, given its irregular shape, is calculated according to two different measured areas: each one of these smaller plots is described separately, marked on the tablet by a line drawn at the end of each paragraph (and indicated below in the paraphrase by LINE).&nbsp;<br /> Overall, the purchased land consists of 0;2.3.3.9 Kor (7042, 5 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>). It consists of a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>), and is located at the branch of the Borsippa Canal in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon. LINE.&nbsp;<br /> The first measured area (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>) is first defined by its borders: the upper side in the North measures 583 2/3 cubits (291,8 m) and borders on (the property of) <strong>C</strong>; its lower side in the South measures 580 5/6 cubits (290,4 m) and borders on (the property of) <strong>D</strong>. Its fronts measure 44 1/8 cubits (22,08 m), and are adjacent to (the property of) <strong>E</strong> and his brothers in the West, and the royal street (<em>harrān &scaron;arri</em>) in the East. In total, this area consists of 0;2.2.3.1 Kor (6532,5 m<sup>2</sup>) of land, including (<em>adi</em>) 0;0.0.1.4 Kor (105 m<sup>2</sup>) of bow property (<em>bīt qa&scaron;ti</em>), whose upper and lower borders (<em>miṣru</em>) are included in this plot of land. LINE<br /> The second measured area (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>) is also defined through its bordering properties: its upper side in the North measures 48 cubits (24 m) and borders on (the property of) <strong>C</strong>, the lower side in the South measures 50 cubits (25 m) and borders on (the property of) <strong>D</strong>; its fronts measure 41 2/3 (20,8 m) cubits and are adjacent to the royal street (<em>harrān &scaron;arri</em>) in the West and to the royal marshes (<em>raqqatu &scaron;a &scaron;arri</em>) in the East. In total, this area consists of 0;0.1.0.8 Kor (510 m<sup>2</sup>) of land. LINE<br /> The total surface of this measured field (<em>eqlu mi&scaron;ihtu</em>) is 0;2.3.3.9 Kor (7042,5 m<sup>2</sup>). LINE<br /> <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent for this land together with the seller <strong>B</strong> (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>) to be 1 shekels for each 3 3/4 gar (28,1 m<sup>2</sup>) of land. The buyer gives (<em>nadānu</em>) 4 minas and 10 2/3 shekels of silver as its total price (<em>&scaron;īmi&scaron;u gamrūtu</em>), plus 4 1/3 shekels of silver as additional payment (<em>k&icirc; atri</em>). LINE<br /> <strong>B</strong> acknowledges that he has received (<em>mahāru</em>) in total 4 minas and 15 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), and he is satisfied (<em>apālu </em>&nbsp;G Stat). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. Fingernail impressions (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller <strong>B</strong>, instead of his seal impression (<em>kunukku</em>). Names of 6 witnesses and 2 scribes.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-zēru-iqī&scaron;a/Marduk-&Scaron;arrani//Esagilāya; <strong>C</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Kudurru//I&scaron;pāru; <strong>D</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl/&Scaron;ullumāya//Etel-p&icirc;; <strong>E</strong> = Rēmūtu-Gula/Etellu//I&scaron;pāru"
