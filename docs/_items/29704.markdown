paraphrase: "Litigation: Obligation to pronounce an oath.<br /> The text states that <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s slave, will be available (<em>uzzuzu</em>) on Nisan (I), 1<sup>st</sup>, and swear an oath to the gods before &Scaron;ama&scaron; at its rising (<em>niphu</em>, i.e. at sunrise), (standing) within a magic circle (<em>gi&scaron;huri</em>) and in front of <strong>C</strong>. The dispute is about two promissory notes (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>). The first one, for an amount of 1 mina and 15 shekels of silver, was established the 11<sup>th</sup> of D&ucirc;zu (IV) of Nabonidus&rsquo; 12<sup>th</sup> year: for this<strong>,</strong> <strong>A</strong> took as a pledge (<em>ma&scaron;kanu ṣabātu</em>) the arable land (<em>zēru</em>) located in front of the Gi&scaron;&scaron;u Gate. The second one, for 6 1/4 shekels of silver, was established the 10<sup>th</sup> of Abu (V) of the same year and must be paid by <strong>D</strong>: <strong>A</strong> will bring and show (<em>kalāmu</em> D) this document to <strong>C</strong>. In the oath, <strong>A </strong>will swear that he holds no lawsuit against <strong>C </strong>and that he is committing no fraud (<em>niklu</em>). Neither did he receive silver, barley, clothes (<em>muṣibtu</em>), nor anything else from his property (<em>makkūru</em>) &ndash; nor did he take anything himself, or turned to a superior (<em>mamma el&ucirc;</em>) who did it for him. After <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s death, he did not change (<em>&scaron;an&ucirc; </em>D) the cuneiform writing (<em>tikip santakki</em>) of these promissory notes &ndash; beyond the changes that were made already during <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s life. Then, he will swear that he did not appropriate (<em>katāmu</em>) <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s valuables (<em>bū&scaron;u</em>) or property (<em>makkūru</em>) nor did he say &ldquo;I have it; I know where it is&rdquo;. He must state that he is not holding a <em>deposit </em>(<em>tarkuttu</em>), a promissory note (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>), a special arrangement (<em>riksu</em>), a document (<em>ṭuppu</em>) nor anything else belonging to <strong>D</strong> &ndash; and that he never gave anything to anyone, nor does he know where it has been placed, nor did he give anything to anyone and hide (<em>pasānu</em>) it from (<em>lapān</em>) <strong>C</strong>. According to this oath, he does not claim anything that was not written in the promissory note that he showed (<em>kalāmu</em> D) to <strong>C</strong>. After having sworn this, he will release (<em>mu&scaron;&scaron;uru</em>) <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s [&hellip;]. If he does not swear, <strong>A</strong> will return the previous promissory note dated to D&ucirc;zu (IV) and he will hand it over to <strong>C </strong>(<em>t&acirc;ru</em> D-<em>nadānu</em>). One final clause states that <strong>A</strong> will swear only if the 20<sup>th</sup> day is a free (<em>pet&ucirc;</em>, lit. &lsquo;open&rsquo;) day: if not, then he will swear the following month (Ayyār (II), 20<sup>th</sup>). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-uterri, slave of <strong>B</strong>; <strong>B</strong> = Iddināya (=Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi); <strong>C</strong> = Nādinu; <strong>D</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēre&scaron;"
