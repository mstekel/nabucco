paraphrase: "Receipt of silver, return of the purchase price to the seller.<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchased the (slave-)cook <strong>C</strong> from <strong>B</strong> by proxy. <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong>, the middleman, took (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) 5/6 minas of silver from him in order to pay (<em>eṭēru</em>) the price for the cook to the seller. However, it turned out that <strong>D<sub>1</sub> </strong>did not pay (<em>eṭēru</em>) to the seller. In the present document, <strong>A</strong>, the seller acknowledges that he received ( <em>eṭēru</em>) the outstanding 5/6 minas of silver and the interest on it from <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong>, the middleman&rsquo;s son, according to the promissory note.&nbsp; Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-nādin-apli/Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-zēri//&Scaron;ig&ucirc;a; <strong>B </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-kāṣir/Nūr-S&icirc;n//Iddin-Papsukkal; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-silīm, a (slave?-)cook (<sup>l&uacute;</sup>MU);&nbsp; <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi, son of<strong> D<sub>1</sub></strong>"
