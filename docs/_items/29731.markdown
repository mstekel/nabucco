paraphrase: "Injunction.<br /> By the end of Ta&scaron;rīt (VII), <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> (<strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s wife) will bring and hand over (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;-nadānu</em>) the judge&rsquo;s tablet (<em>ṭuppu</em>) as well as her husband&rsquo;s document (<em>&scaron;aṭāru</em>) to <strong>D</strong>. These documents are related to land (<em>zēru</em>) located on the Hazuzu ditch (<em>harru</em>): <strong>B </strong>donated this land to his wife in the presence of his mother (<strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>) who witnessed the transaction (<em>ana mukinnūtu &scaron;ū&scaron;ubu</em>), wrote a document (attesting the transfer of the property) and gave it to his wife. Now, this land has been bought (<em>ana kaspi mahāru</em>) by <strong>D</strong>, to whom<strong> <sup>f</sup>A</strong> should give the tablets. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Sūqā&rsquo;ītu/Rēmūtu, wife of <strong>B</strong>; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-uballiṭ; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Kuttāya, mother of <strong>B</strong>; <strong>D</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-bān-ahi/Marduk-nāṣir//Mudammiq-Adad"
