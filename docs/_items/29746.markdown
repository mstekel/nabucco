paraphrase: "Establishment of a business partnership<br /> <strong>A</strong> invested 10 shekels of silver in a business partnership with <strong>B</strong> (<em>ana harrāni nadānu</em>), who still owes this silver to <strong>A</strong> (<em>&scaron;a</em> A<em> ina muhhi </em>B). The partners agree that they will share equally (<em>ahi zittu akālu</em>) in the profits (<em>utru</em>) that <strong>B</strong> makes with the silver in or out of town. It is further stipulated that <strong>C</strong> will run the business (<em>ina na&scaron;parti alāku</em>). This silver debt comes in addition to (<em>elat</em>) the 3 shekels of silver which <strong>B</strong> owes within the framework of a business partnership with <strong>D</strong>. It is silver that <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong>, wife of F, the courtier (<em>rē&scaron;-&scaron;arri</em>), ordered (<em>ina amāti</em>) to give to <strong>B.</strong><br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-Sin; <strong>B</strong> = &Scaron;a-Nab&ucirc;-li&scaron;lim, slave of <strong>F</strong>; <strong>C </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-zuqup-en&scaron;u; <strong>D</strong> = &Scaron;iriktu/Nūrea//Dannea; <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Qī&scaron;āya,&nbsp; wife<sup>?</sup> of <strong>F</strong>; <strong>F</strong> = Īnia (<em>rē&scaron;-&scaron;arri</em>)"
