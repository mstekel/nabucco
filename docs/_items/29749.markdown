paraphrase: "Fragmentary receipt<br /> The tablet is too damaged to reconstruct its content. It belongs to the Egibi/Nūr-S&icirc;n archive because Iddin-Marduk(/Iqi&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n) and his wife <sup>f</sup>Ina-Esagila-rāmat(/Zēria//Nabāya) are mentioned. Legible are the verb <em>mahāru </em>and the word <em>bitqu</em>, which may indicate that the document is a receipt of an amount of silver. Apart from the names of 2 witnesses, name of the scribe, place and date are broken."
