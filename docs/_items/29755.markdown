paraphrase: "Addendum to a land sale.<br /> <strong>A </strong>purchased (<em>ina qātē &hellip; mahāru</em>) two plots of land: the first one was a plot of arable land (<em>zēru</em>) situated along the Sukull&acirc;tu-street, which he bought from <strong>D</strong> and his brothers by means of his proxy, <strong>B</strong>. This land was part of the dowry (<em>nudunn&ucirc;</em>) of the sellers&rsquo; mother <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>; the price, a non-specified amount of silver, was payed to <strong>D</strong> and his brothers. Later, <strong>A</strong> also bought (<em>ina qātē &hellip; mahāru</em>) a 0;0.1.1 Kor (525 m<sup>2</sup>) plot of arable land (<em>zēru</em>) that was part of the parcel (<em>qutānu</em>)&nbsp;of <strong>D</strong> and his brothers; he paid it with silver. The present document was drafted with the sole aim to point out that <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s wife (<strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong>) witnessed the sales (<em>ana mukinnūti wa&scaron;ābu</em>), thus implying her consent to them. The related text BM30449, written the same day as this document, records the presence of another woman (the wife of one of <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s brothers) among the witnesses; the name of the mother is written differently in the two tablets, however it must be the same person. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe. The technical term for proxy is not used, but <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s role is inferable from the content of the text.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-bān-ahi/Marduk-nāṣir//Mudammiq-Adad; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Kuttāya/Bēl-upahhir//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu; <strong>D</strong> = &Scaron;āpik-zēri/&Scaron;umu-ukīn//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu; <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong> = <sup>f</sup>[&hellip;], wife of <strong>D</strong>"
