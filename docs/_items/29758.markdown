paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> The tablet records the purchase of agricultural land; the text has been divided into paragraphs, marked on the tablet by a line drawn at the end of each one (and indicated below in the paraphrase by LINE).<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases land from <strong>B</strong>: the upper part of the tablet, with the description of the purchased land, is broken; only a family name, Atu, is extant. (LINE) The details on its size and location are still readable: its upper side in the North measures 3750 cubits (1875 m) and borders on (the property of) <strong>B</strong>; its lower side in the South, that has the same length as the upper side, is adjacent to (the property of) <strong>A</strong>. Its upper front in the West, 30 cubits (15 m) long, is on the bank of the Euphrates (<em>ki&scaron;ād puratti</em>) and the lower front in the East, same size, borders on (the property of) <strong>C</strong>. LINE<br /> The total area of this plot of land is 1;4.3.3 kor (25875 m<sup>2</sup>). It consists of 0;2.0.3 kor (5625 m<sup>2</sup>) of land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>) valued (<em>&scaron;uqultu</em>) 1 mina and 15 shekels, at a ratio of 1 shekel of silver for each 0;0.0.1 kor (75 m<sup>2</sup>) of land,&nbsp; and 1;2.3 kor (20250 m<sup>2</sup>) of cultivated as well as newly cleared land (<em>mēre&scaron;u u tapt&ucirc;</em>) valued (<em>&scaron;uqultu</em>) 45 shekels at a ratio of 1 shekel of silver for each 0;0.1 kor (450 m<sup>2</sup>) of land). <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent for this land together with the seller <strong>B</strong> (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>) to be 2 minas of silver. He pays (<em>nadānu</em>) him the total purchase price (<em>&scaron;īmi&scaron;u gamrūtu</em>), plus 3 shekels of silver as additional payment (<em>k&icirc; atri</em>). LINE<br /> <strong>B</strong> acknowledges that he has received (<em>mahāru</em>) in total 2 minas and 3 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), and he is satisfied (<em>apālu </em>&nbsp;G Stat). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. Names of 7 witnesses (including one woman, <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong>, wife of <strong>A</strong>) and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Kidin-Marduk/Zēria//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Gula; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-&scaron;umu-ibni/Nab&ucirc;-bān-ahi//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Gula; <strong>C </strong>= Bēl-iddin/Nūr-Ea//At&ucirc;;<strong><sup> f</sup>D</strong> = <sup>f</sup>(Ina)-Esagil-rāmat/...//Gahul, wife of <strong>A</strong>"
