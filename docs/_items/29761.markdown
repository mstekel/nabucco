paraphrase: "Exchange of land and slaves.<br /> The document records the exchange (<em>ṭuppi &scaron;up&ecirc;lti</em>) of a building plot (<em>eqel bīti</em>) with land and female slaves (<em>a&scaron;tapiru</em>) that <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> together with his wife <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> have switched with each other (<em>ana ahāmi&scaron; &scaron;up&ecirc;lu</em>). First, a description of the building plot is provided. Its long side in the West measures 56 2/3 cubits (c. 28,3 m) and is adjacent to the houses of <strong>C</strong>, <strong>D </strong>and <strong>E</strong>; the long side in the East is 54 1/3 cubits (c. 27,1 m) long and is adjacent to the house of <strong>F</strong>. The front side in the North measures 21 1/3 cubits (c. 10,6 m) and borders on the wide street (<em>sūqu rap&scaron;u</em>), the thoroughfare of gods and the king; the front side in the South is&nbsp; 20 2/3 cubits (c. 10, 3 m) long and adjacent to the house of <strong>G</strong>. The total surface of this building plot in Hursagkalamma, in the city of Ki&scaron;, is 24 sq. r (294 m<sup>2</sup>): this is <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong>&lsquo;s house. <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s property consists of 1 Kor (13500 m<sup>2</sup>) of arable land (<em>zēru</em>), cultivated (<em>mēre&scaron;u</em>) and located in &Scaron;uppatu near the house of [PN]; to this, he adds three slaves (<em>a&scaron;tapiru</em>) <strong><sup>f</sup>H<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>H<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>H<sub>3</sub></strong>. <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, have exchanged with each other these properties with full and voluntary consent (<em>ina migir libbi&scaron;unu</em>); each one of them guarantees (<em>pūtu na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) for the exchanged goods. There will be no future comeback nor claim. They write this document recording the exchange (<em>ṭuppi &scaron;up&ecirc;lti</em>) in order to make sure that the agreement will not be changed (<em>lā en&ucirc;</em>) and each one takes a copy of it. Names of 6 witnesses (including <sup>f</sup>I, <sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub>&lsquo;s sister) and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nādin/Nādin-ahi//Amēl-Isin; <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Inṣabtu/Marduk-&scaron;umu-uṣur/Arad-Nergal, wife of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>C</strong> = Iribāya/Nādin; <strong>D</strong> = Libluṭ/Marduk-nāṣir//Nūr-Adad; <strong>E</strong> = Bēl-iddin/Arad-Gula//Zērāya; <strong>F</strong> = Basia/Iqī&scaron;; <strong>G</strong> = Mukīl-appāti; <strong><sup>f</sup>H<sub>1</sub></strong>= <sup>f</sup>&Scaron;a-Ninlil-udda; <strong><sup>f</sup>H<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Nanāya-Ittia; <strong><sup>f</sup>H<sub>3</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Nanāya-kilīlī-uṣrī; <strong><sup>f</sup>I </strong>= <sup>f</sup>&Scaron;in-ban&acirc;/Marduk-&scaron;uma-uṣur//Arad-Nergal"
