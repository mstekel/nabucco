paraphrase: "Interim settlement of accounts within the framework of a business partnership (harranu). Very fragmentary.<br /> The document opens by listing the amounts that each of the partners withdrew (<em>nasāhu</em>) from the business account, but is broken off in the middle. All that is preserved is that <strong>A</strong> withdrew 1 mina 33 1/4 shekels of silver and <strong>B</strong> apparenty the same amount.&nbsp; Remainder lost. Names of at least 3 witnesses and the scribe: &hellip;/Bēl-rēmanni//&hellip; .<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl&scaron;unu/Bēl-ahhē-iddin//S&icirc;n-imitti&nbsp;"
