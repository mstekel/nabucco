paraphrase: "Resolution for a dispute related to rights of access.<br /> The text sets forth that<strong> A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> can use only their own way out (<em>mūṣ&ucirc;</em>) which is located near the canal. They are not allowed to use the path which is found behind <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s house: that way out belongs (exclusively) to <strong>B</strong>. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> A<sub>1</sub> = Marduk-erība/Rēmūtu//Miṣirayyu; A<sub>2</sub> = Kalbāya/Balāṭu/Rab-ban&ecirc;; B = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi"
