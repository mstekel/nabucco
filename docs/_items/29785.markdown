paraphrase: "Land rental.<br /> <strong>A</strong> and his brothers rent land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>) located along the Bitqu-&scaron;a-Ile&rsquo;&rsquo;i-Bēl to <strong>B, </strong>who should perform gardening work (<em>nukaribbūtu</em>). In Abu (V) he should carry out the excavation work for irrigation; he will take care of the palm fronds (<em>libbu</em>) and branches (<em>harūtu</em>). He will not cut off sprouts (<em>raṭbu</em>). As long as he will dig ditches using a winnowing shovel (<em>pīsu</em>) and remove lumps (<em>parku</em>) from the ground, he will receive 5 kor (900 l) of dates per kor that he will have farmed as gardener&#39;s remuneration (<em>&scaron;issinnu</em>). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Kalbāya/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Tabnēa/Marduk-&scaron;umu-uṣur-ibni//&Scaron;a-nā&scaron;ī&scaron;u"
