paraphrase: "Settlement of accounts.<br /> Contract (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) related to the settlement of accounts (<em>epu&scaron; nikkassi</em>) between <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>. <strong>A </strong>swears an oath to<strong> B</strong> acknowledging that he still owes him 10 shekels of silver; it is also acknowledged that <strong>A</strong> has already given (<em>nadānu</em>) the remaining (<em>rīhtu</em>) 4 1/3 shekels of silver to <strong>B </strong>(this debt likely refers to the lease of a house and a slave, as recorded in BM33918). The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each. Name of 1 witness and the scribe: Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu/Marduk-bāni-zēri//Bēl-ēṭir.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Kalbāya/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi"
