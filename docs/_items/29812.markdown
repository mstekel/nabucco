paraphrase: "Deposition before witnesses.<br /> The tablet records the names of those who witnessed (<em>ina pāni&scaron;unu</em>) a statement pronounced by <strong>A</strong> to <strong>B</strong>. The content of the dialogue is lost, the only readable words refer to an oath taken by C. Rest broken off. Names of 2 witnesses, no scribe. With place of issue, and dated.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Rēmūtu/Bēl-nādinapli; <strong>B</strong> = L&acirc;bā&scaron;i/Zeria//Nabāya; <strong>C</strong> = Iqī&scaron;āya"
