Also the reverse is almost completely lost, and all that is preserved is the very end of the transaction: as compensation payment for a loss caused (<em>mull&ucirc;</em>) &hellip; followed by the list of witnesses that were present at this court verdict (<em>puruss&icirc; dīni</em>): names of the <em>sartennu</em>-official: S&icirc;n-erība; and 8 judges (<em>dayyānu</em>), a.o. Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; and the names of 2 scribes: Nādinu//Pahāru, and Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun//Rab-ban&ecirc;"
