paraphrase: "Confirmation of payment.<br /> It concerns the 5;3.0 kor (c. 1008 l.) of [seeds?] that B owes to<strong> A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>. A fragmentary passage makes clear that this claim (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>, wr. <em>ri-&scaron;u-tu<sub>4</sub></em>) has apparently been paid by <strong>C</strong>, because any document that <em>may</em> <em>turn up</em> (?) in this matter should be regarded as <em>belonging to&nbsp;</em>(?!) (text has <em>ina muhhi</em>) <strong>C</strong>. The creditors cannot bring a suit (<em>dabābu</em>) against him. They have been paid (<em>eṭēru</em>). Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>. A short note at the end of this document points out that a debt owed by <strong>D</strong> to the same creditors should be considered paid they turn up, they belong to <strong>C</strong> (<strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s son). (cf. BM31384)<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Marduk-&scaron;umu-ibni/Bēl-rēmanni//Balāṭu; <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = &Scaron;āpik-zēri/ Nergal-u&scaron;allim//S&icirc;n-karābī-i&scaron;me; <strong>B</strong> = Ardia/Nab&ucirc;-zēru-ukīn//...; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/<em>&Scaron;ulāya</em>//<em>Egibi</em>, son of D; <strong>D</strong> = &Scaron;ulāya/Zēru-ukīn//Egibi"
