It consists parly of a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) bearing fruit (<em>iṣṣi bilti</em>) and partly of cultivated as well as newly cleared land (<em>mēre&scaron;u u tapt&ucirc;</em>). Within this total area, 0;2.0.3 Kor (5625 m<sup>2</sup>) corresponds to the surface of the land cultivated with dates, whose value (<em>&scaron;uqultu</em>) corresponds to 1 mina and 15 shekels of silver; 1;2.3 Kor (20250 m<sup>2</sup>) is the surface of the cultivated as well as newly cleared land (<em>mēre&scaron;u u tapt&ucirc;</em>), whose value (<em>&scaron;uqultu</em>) corresponds to 45 shekels of silver.<br /> 2) <strong>C</strong> also bought 1;1.4 Kor (18000 m<sup>2</sup>) of cultivated land (<em>zēru mēre&scaron;u</em>), of which 1 Kor (13500 m<sup>2</sup>) is of lower quality (<em>kal&ucirc; u gabību</em>), for 37 1/4 shekels of silver from <strong>E</strong> (A <em>ina qātē </em>C &hellip; <em>mahīra epe&scaron;u</em>).<br /> 3) <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>4</sub></strong> bought a plot of land, whose surface details are lost in a lacuna, for 43 1/3 shekels of silver from [<strong>E?</strong>] (<sup>f</sup>D <em>ina qātē </em>[PN] &hellip; <em>mahīra epe&scaron;u</em>). This plot is located in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>) and it is a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>).<br /> 4) The same woman bought for the same amount of silver another plot of land whose area is unknown, from a seller whose name is also lost. The land is located in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>): it is a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) bearing fruit (<em>iṣṣi bilti</em>).<br /> 5) <strong>C</strong> also bought 0;3.2 Kor (6300 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>) for 1 mina of silver, from <strong>F</strong> (A <em>ina qātē </em>E &hellip; <em>mahīra epe&scaron;u</em>). This area includes a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) bearing fruit (<em>iṣṣi bilti</em>) as well as cultivated land (<em>mēre&scaron;u</em>).<br /> 6) The description of the last plot of agricultural land is lost in a lacuna, only the term wasteland (<em>ki&scaron;ubb&ucirc;</em>) can be read with certainty.<br /> Then, the text records the purchase of 2 more areas (<em>erṣetu</em>):<br /> 7) Details for the first one cannot be read because of a gap in the tablet: from what is left, we know that <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>4</sub></strong> bought this land from someone (whose name is lost) for [x]+2/3 minas of silver.<br /> 8) <strong>G</strong> bought an area of 6 sq. r (73,50 m<sup>2</sup>) in Tē, inside the city of Babylon, for 2 minas and 4 shekels of silver from <strong>H<sub>1</sub></strong> and his wife <strong><sup>f</sup>H<sub>2</sub></strong> (G <em>ina qātē </em>H<sub>1</sub> <em>u</em> <sup>f</sup>H<sub>2</sub> &hellip; <em>mahīra epe&scaron;u</em>).<br /> Finally, the purchase of the three slaves <strong>I<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>I<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>I<sub>3</sub></strong> is mentioned: their price (<em>mahīrāti&scaron;unu</em>) amounts to 5 minas of silver.<br /> Then, the tablet provides the totals: 4;3.5.3 kor (64575 m<sup>2</sup>) of cultivated land sold for 5 minas and 49 shekels of silver &ndash; inclusive of the additional payment (<em>adi</em> <em>atri</em>); 27;5.6 sq. r (371,85 m<sup>2</sup>) of land sold for 13 minas and 48 1/2 shekels of silver &ndash; inclusive of the additional payment and of the clothing (<em>adi</em> <em>atri u lubāri</em>); three slaves <strong>I<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>I<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>I<sub>3</sub></strong>, sold for 5 minas of silver.<br /> Now,<strong> A </strong>purchases all these properties for 24 minas and 37 shekels of silver, i.e. their full price (<em>&scaron;īmī&scaron;u</em><sup>!</sup> <em>gamrūtu</em>), from <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> (uncle of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>), <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>3</sub></strong> (grandmother of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>) and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>4</sub></strong> (mother of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and wife of <strong>C</strong>). The sellers confirm that they have received (<em>mahāru</em>) the whole amount of silver which was due for their fields, houses and slaves, and they are satisfied (<em>aplū</em>) All the parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received.<br /> The income of these business deals are then transferred to <strong>L<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>L<sub>2</sub></strong>, the creditors (<em>rā&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) of <strong>C</strong> (<strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s father), <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>3</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>4</sub></strong>: they take out 20 minas and 17 shekels from the total amount of silver, as payment for their credit (<em>ina ra&scaron;&ucirc;ti&scaron;unu</em>). <strong>M<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>M<sub>2</sub></strong>, who previously took a house as pledge (<em>ma&scaron;kanu ṣabātu</em>) and have lived inside it since then, take the remaining silver: 4 minas and 20 shekels.<br /> Finally, the text states that the fingernails (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the sellers <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>3</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>4</sub></strong> are impressed on the tablet instead of their seal impressions (<em>kunukku</em>).
