paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases 1 Kor (13500 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>), cultivated as well as newly cleared land (<em>mēre&scaron;u u tapt&ucirc;</em>) located in front of the Ura&scaron; Gate in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon from <strong>B</strong>. The upper long side in the North borders on (the land of) <strong>C</strong>, the lower long side in the South on (the land of) <strong>D</strong>. Its upper front in the West borders on (the land of) the sons of <strong>E</strong>, its lower front in the East borders on the dam of the&nbsp;<em>han&scaron;u</em>s (<em>makall&ucirc; &scaron;a han&scaron;ānē</em>) of Babylon. Having agreed upon the price of 1 shekel of silver for each 0;0.2 Kor (900 m<sup>2</sup>), the total value (<em>&scaron;uqultu</em>) for this field corresponds to 15 shekels of silver. The final section of the text, which no doubt included the usual closing and warranty clauses, is poorly preserved. One closing line states that the date palms of that field now belong to <strong>A</strong>, who has also access to the water (<em>m&ecirc; &scaron;a </em>A). Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe: <strong>B</strong>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-rēmanni/Nab&ucirc;-zēru-iqī&scaron;a//Esagilāya; <strong>C</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Kudurru//I&scaron;pāru; <strong>D</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-uballiṭ/Zēr-Bābili//Etel-p&icirc;; <strong>E</strong> = Etellu/I&scaron;pāru"
