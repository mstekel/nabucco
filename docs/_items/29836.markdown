paraphrase: "Court protocol: litigation about the transfer of assets.<br /> Any special agreement (<em>riksu</em>) or a document (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) about the 2;2 sq. kor (c. 32400 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>), the dowry estate (<em>bīt nudunn&icirc;</em>) of <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong>, that <strong>A</strong>, her eldest son, may have concluded (<em>rakāsu</em>, wr. <em>i&scaron;-ku-su</em>) with her, and would bring along (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) in a dispute with (<em>ana muhhi</em>) his mother: the document belongs to her. The royal scribe transmitted under a sealed document (<em>kanāku</em> - <em>dagālu</em> &Scaron;) that land to <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong>, as the equivalent for (<em>kum</em>) her dowry. In the document it is explicitly mentioned that if anyone among her sons would not respect her (<em>palāhu</em>), then he would not receive (<em>leq&ucirc;</em>) a share (<em>zittu</em>) in that property. According to that first document that is in <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong>&rsquo;s hands, 1;1 kor (16200 m<sup>2</sup>) out of the total 2;2 sq. kor (c. 32400 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) was the share of her eldest son <strong>A</strong>. Later, however, she transferred the ownership of this land under a sealed document (<em>kanāku</em> - <em>dagālu</em> &Scaron;) to her younger sons <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>. <strong>A</strong> raised a claim (<em>paqāru ba&scaron;&ucirc; </em>&Scaron;) against this decision, but <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> brought the tablet in front of the city elders and her eldest son retreated (<em>t&acirc;ru</em> D). Now, <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s name is included among the witnesses list in the tablet related to the transfer of the ownership of those 1.1 kor of land which she gave (<em>kanāku</em> - <em>dagālu</em> &Scaron;) to <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>. Names of 5 witnesses and the scribe: Ea-iddin/Balāṭu//Ma&scaron;tuk.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-u&scaron;allim/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-ukīn//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu; <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Kurunnam-tabni/Bēl-upahhir//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu, mother of <strong>A, C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = &Scaron;āpik-zēri; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bēl-uballiṭ"
