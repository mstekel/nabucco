paraphrase: "Purchase of a building plot.<br /> <strong>A </strong>purchases 0;1 sq. r (12,25 m<sup>2</sup>) of land from <strong>B</strong>: this consists of a building plot with a house in ruin located in Tē, near Babylon. The upper long side in the West borders on <strong>A</strong>&lsquo;s house, the lower long side in the East is adjacent to <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s house. The upper front in the North and the lower front in the South border on <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s house as well. <strong>A</strong> has declared the equivalent for this land, 0;1 sq. r (12,25 m<sup>2</sup>) in total, together with the seller <strong>B</strong>: 1/2 mina of silver for each 1/2 sq. r (12,25 m<sup>2</sup>) of land, for a total amount of 1/2 mina of silver. The buyer pays the total purchase price, plus 1 shekel of silver as additional payment (<em>atru</em>) and a garment (<em>lubāru</em>) for the lady of the (sold) house. <strong>B</strong> acknowledges that he has received 1/2 mina and 1 shekel of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Ubārya/Bēl-rēṣūa"
