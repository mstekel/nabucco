paraphrase: "About the return of equipment from a private house.<br /> Concerns all equipment (<em>ud&ucirc;</em>), as much as there is, belonging to a woman from Medea (<sup>f</sup><strong>D</strong>), who lives (<em>a&scaron;ābu</em>) in <strong>E</strong>&#39;s house. After her husband (<strong>A</strong>) and<strong> <sup>f</sup>B</strong> were given back (<em>eṭēru</em>) all this equipment by the landlord&#39;s grandson (<strong>C</strong>)*, they swore (<em>tam&ucirc;</em>) by Bēl, Nab&ucirc; and the king. The wording of their oath is lost in a badly preserved passage. It refers to something that is due from <strong>C</strong>, and to the final balance payment (<em>aḫirtu, </em>var. of<em> amirtu</em>)&nbsp; that they should, so it seems, settle with each other.<br /> *lit. &quot;the eldest son of <strong>E</strong>&#39;s daughter&quot;.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Kakia, husband of <sup>f</sup><strong>D</strong>; <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> =<sup> f</sup>Nanāya;&nbsp; <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong> =<sup> f</sup>Uhia, woman from Medea (<sup>l&uacute;</sup><em>ma-du-&lsquo;i-tu</em><sub>4</sub>), wife of <strong>A; C </strong>= &Scaron;iriktu/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu(?)//Egibi,&nbsp; the eldest son of <strong>E</strong>&#39;s daughter (<sup>f</sup>Nuptaia); <strong>E </strong>= Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n."
