paraphrase: "Establishment of a business partnership (harranu).<br /> <strong>A</strong> invests 15 minas of stamped(?) silver (<em>ginnu</em>) in a business partnership with <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>. The partners agree that <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> will enjoy a share (<em>ahu akālu</em>) in the profits (<em>utru</em>) they make with the silver in or out of town that equals (<em>itti</em>) <strong>A</strong>&#39;s share. This is followed by a broken passage after which it is provided that <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> assume warranty for each other. They also guarantee for the mentioned capital sum of silver. It may not be used to cover their expenses (<em>etēqu ina muhhi ul etēqu</em>). Furthermore, <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> may not take part in another (business partnership) (<em>harrānu alāku</em>) apart from (<em>elat</em>) the present one. There are no other funds available apart from the mentioned silver of <strong>A</strong> [&hellip;] (and?) of<strong> C</strong>, who seems to be <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>&#39;s father. Names of xxx witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Bēl-kāṣir/Marduk-u&scaron;allim//A&scaron;lāku; <strong>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Nidintu-Bēl/&Scaron;a-Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;ū//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Ninurta; <strong>C </strong>= Marduk-u&scaron;allim"
