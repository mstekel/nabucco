paraphrase: "Fragment of a tablet recording the purchase of land.<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases land from <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong>. The field must have been divided up into smaller areas when describing its measurement and neighbours, but most of this information is lost, except for the second partial area (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>). Its land is adjacent to the dam [of the&nbsp;<em>han&scaron;u</em>s?] (<em>makall&ucirc; </em>[<em>&scaron;a han&scaron;ānē</em>?]) and is cultivated with 5 date palms (<em>gi&scaron;immarē</em>), [&hellip;] that are inside (<em>ina libbi</em>) an area of&nbsp; x+1;2.0.2 Kor (19050+ m<sup>2</sup>). In total, [&hellip; x]+2;1.5.4.2 1/2 Kor (32268+ m<sup>2</sup>) of land cultivated with trees and grain (<em>zēru zaqpu u mēre&scaron;u</em>). Every other detail on the deal, together with the names of the witnesses and of the scribe, are lost.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/&hellip;//Ṭābih-kāri; <strong><sup>f</sup>B </strong>= <sup>f</sup>Ra&hellip;/&hellip;-Bēl-zēri//Abu-ul-īde"
