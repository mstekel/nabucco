paraphrase: "Exchange of land.<br /> The document records the exchange (<em>ṭuppi &scaron;up&ecirc;lti</em>) of plots of land (<em>eqlēti</em>) which <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> have switched with each other (<em>ana ahāmi&scaron; &scaron;up&ecirc;lu</em>). <strong>B</strong> brings in 0;3.4 Kor (9900 m<sup>2</sup>) of arable land (<em>zēru</em>) located above the New Canal in front of the Enlil Gate, in the district (<em>pīḫatu</em>) of Babylon. The upper long side in the West borders on (the property of) <strong>D</strong>, the lower side in the South on (the property of) <strong>E</strong>; the upper front in the North is adjacent to the bank (<em>ki&scaron;ādu</em>) of the New Canal and the lower front in the South borders on (the property of) <strong>F</strong>. <strong>B</strong> exchanges this land, which includes (<em>adi</em>) his wife&#39;s dowry land (<em>zēru nudunni</em>) &nbsp;with 0;3.4 kor (9900 m<sup>2</sup>) of arable land belonging to <strong>A</strong>. This consists of a field whose description is lost because the tablet is damaged; only the name of one of the neighbours is extant: <strong>G</strong>. After a gap in the text, the document ends with the usual warranty clause in which the parties agreed that there will be no future comeback nor claim. They write this document recording the exchange (<em>ṭuppi &scaron;up&ecirc;lti</em>) in order to make sure that this agreement will not be changed (<em>lā en&ucirc;</em>) and each one takes a copy of it. Names of 5 witnesses (including <strong>H</strong>, <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s brother) and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Munahhi&scaron;-Marduk/Bānia//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Ninurta; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Inṣabtu/Ardi-Bēl//Pappāya; <strong>D</strong> = Iddināya/Rēmūt; <strong>E</strong> = Ṭābia/Kabtia; <strong>F</strong> = Bazūzu/Rēmūt; <strong>G</strong> = Erēb&scaron;u; <strong>H</strong> = Nergal-ēṭir/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi"
