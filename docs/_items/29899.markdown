They each took 20 shekels of silver (<em>nishūtu nasāhu</em>) from the business&rsquo; accounts. There follows a list of expenses for various items: a leather bag (<em>nūṭu</em>), fat (<em>lipu</em>) of the <em>nashapu-</em>type, beef (<em>&scaron;īr alpi</em>) and other meat (<em>&scaron;īru</em>), and payments to <strong>C</strong> and<strong> D</strong>. The document concludes by stating that the expenses of the current year till today have been calculated (<em>man&ucirc;</em>) as amounting to 1 mina and 50 shekels.
