paraphrase: "Oath. Dispute over the manufacturing of furniture and payment of a salary.<br /> Agreement between <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> for the delivery of a bed which <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s father, <strong>C</strong>, agreed to produce against the payment of 13 shekels of silver, but which he eventually did not deliver. <strong>A</strong> swears to <strong>B</strong>, by Bēl, Nab&ucirc; and the king, that he will surely be present on the established day (D&ucirc;zu (IV), 10<sup>th</sup>) and let <strong>B</strong> record (<em>uzuzzu </em>&Scaron;) his name instead of his father&rsquo;s. The oath refers to a previous promissory note (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) for a bed made of <em>musukkannu</em>-wood, which was written at the expense of his father <strong>C</strong>. <strong>A</strong> accepted (<em>mahāru</em>) of his own free will (<em>ina zak&ucirc;ti</em>) to make the bed instead of his father. If <strong>A</strong> will not be present on&nbsp; D&ucirc;zu (IV), 10<sup>th</sup>, to discuss with <strong>B</strong> about this promissory note (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) over which he took responsibility (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) of his own free will (<em>ina zak&ucirc;ti</em>), then he will have to deliver that bed made with <em>musukkannu-</em>, <em>dimmigirru-</em> and fig-wood to <strong>B</strong> &ndash; who will give (<em>nadānu</em>) him 13 shekels of silver in return. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Nab&ucirc;-iddin/Nab&ucirc;-gāmil//Suhāya.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Libluṭ (written Bēl-ile&rsquo;&rsquo;i)/Nab&ucirc;-mitu-uballiṭ//Mudammiq-Adad; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Nab&ucirc;-mitu-uballiṭ//Mudammiq-Adad; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-mitu-uballiṭ"
