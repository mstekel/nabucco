paraphrase: "About a slave sale: cancellation of the deal and restitution of money and slaves.<br /> <strong>A </strong>sold his female slaves <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong> with her two daughters <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>3</sub></strong> [...] to <strong>B</strong> for 2 2/3 minas of silver, in Hubad&ecirc;&scaron;u. The deal however was cancelled, and now <strong>B </strong>akcnowledges that he has received back (<em>eṭēru</em>) the 2 2/3 minas of silver from <strong>A</strong>; he also promptly gives back (<em>t&acirc;ru </em>D) the promissory note (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) related to the entire purchase price for these female slaves. As soon as <strong>A</strong> will send a messenger (<em>mār &scaron;ipri</em>) to <strong>B</strong> in Babylon, then (<strong>B</strong>) will give the slaves to the messenger. If a slave has died (<em>maṭ&ucirc;</em>) or has given birth (<em>alādu</em>) while at <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s place, <strong>A</strong> bears the loss as well as the profit (lit. &quot;it is of A&quot;). The parties to the contract have taken one document each. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Habaṣīru/Niqūdu; <strong>B</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Miṣatu; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Nanāya-bēl-uṣur, daughter of <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>3</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>&Scaron;ēpit-Ninlil-aṣbat, daughter of <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong>"
