paraphrase: "Land rental.<br /> <strong>A</strong> and his brothers rent land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>) located along the Harru-&scaron;a-Zabuna to <strong>B, </strong>who should perform gardening work (<em>nukaribbūtu</em>). In Abu (V) he should carry out the excavation work (<em>her&ucirc;tu</em>) for irrigation (<em>labku</em>), he should dig ditches using a winnowing shovel (<em>pīsu</em>). He should remove the clods (<em>akkullātu</em>) and take care of the palm fronds (<em>libbu</em>) and branches (<em>harūtu</em>). He will not cut off the twigs (<em>hūpu</em>). As long as he will farm the land with the shovel (<em>parzillu</em>), he will receive 5 kor (900 l) of dates per kor of land as gardener&#39;s remuneration (<em>&scaron;issinnu</em>). Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-iddin/Kināya"
