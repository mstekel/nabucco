paraphrase: "Court protocol.<br /> The beginning of the text is fragmentary: from what is extant, one understands that <strong>A, </strong>by means of his proxy <strong>C,</strong> bought a female slave from <strong>B </strong>for the <em>hariṣ</em>-price amounting to 2 1/3 minas of silver; it is also mentioned that the slave is performing duties on behalf of&nbsp; <strong>A</strong>. Now, <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s wife and mother-in-law, have brought suit because of this slave and they therefore came in front of Nabonidus&rsquo; judges. The judges heard their testimony and read the documents related to <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s dowry. According to these, the female slave is not part of her dowry; they have brought <strong>B</strong> in their presence and let <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub></strong> take as a pledge the arable land located on the Royal Canal, which is <strong>B</strong>&lsquo;s inheritance share. In future times, <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>2</sub></strong> will not raise claims about this slave nor about the price paid by <strong>C</strong>. <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s name is identified in the tablet as buyer. Names of the witnesses and the scribe are broken.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-tultab&scaron;i-lī&scaron;ir/Bēl-zēru-ibni//Nappāhu; <strong>C</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Esagila-rāmat, wife of B;<strong> <sup>f</sup>D<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ta&scaron;mētu-damqat, mother of <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub></strong>"
