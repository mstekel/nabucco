paraphrase: "Cancellation of a previous agreement.<br /> <strong>B<sub>1 </sub></strong>owes silver to <strong>A</strong>, and for this he pledged his slaves <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong>, and <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>3</sub></strong> (as recorded in BM30521 and BMUnknown(Nbn 602)). Apparently he was unable to pay for his debt, so <strong>A</strong> took away (<em>ana kaspi abāku</em>) the three female slaves from him. Afterwards, the debtor&rsquo;s mother <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub> </strong>provided enough silver to redeem 2 of the 3 slaves and accordingly <strong>A</strong> gave <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong> back (<em>t&acirc;ru</em> D) to <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong>. The debtors ceded (<em>u&scaron;&scaron;uru</em>) <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>3</sub></strong> to <strong>A</strong>, because of (<em>ak&icirc;</em>) the silver that they still owe him. Now, <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> promise not to dispose of the 2 redeemed slaves, nor to give them as a present to anyone, until the arrangement set up (<em>riksu rakāsu</em>) between <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s brother, <strong>D</strong>, will be settled (<em>qat&ucirc;</em>). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu/Marduk-bāni-zēri//Bēl-ēṭir.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Bēl-iddin/Bānia//Arrabtu; <strong><sup>f </sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Nidintu/Arad-Bēl//Egibi, mother of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>&Scaron;annāya, female slave; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Kubbuttu, female slave; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>3</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Tabluṭu, female slave, daughter of <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>D</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-balāssu-iqbi/Bānia//Arrabtu, brother of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>"
