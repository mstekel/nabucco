paraphrase: "Takeover of a guaranty of payment.<br /> <strong>A</strong> (the debtor&rsquo;s brother) guarantees for the payment of 2 minas of silver, which <strong>B</strong> owes to <strong>C. </strong>&nbsp;He will bring and hand over (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em> - <em>nadānu</em>) to <strong>B</strong>, his brother, the receipt (<em>giṭṭu</em>) related to the payment. They will take out (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc; </em>N) from their own assets (<em>ultu ramāni</em>) (the amount needed) for the (payment of the) debt (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) they owe to someone whose name is lost in a lacuna within the context of business partnership (<em>harrānu</em>). The final clause of the text establishes that they have completely carried out (<em>qat&ucirc;</em>) their settlement of accounts (<em>epu&scaron; nikkassi</em>). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Bēl-ibni/Nab&ucirc;-bān-ahi//Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-kāṣir/Marduk-erība//S&icirc;n-ilī; <strong>B </strong>= Rēmūtu/Marduk-erība//S&icirc;n-ilī; <strong>C </strong>= Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n"
