paraphrase: "Statement pronounced in front of witnesses.<br /> The text has been written with the purpose of recording the names of the witnesses who were present when <strong>A</strong> declared that &nbsp;<strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> <em>has received</em> (? the verb is lost in a lacuna) the 2 minas and 6 2/3 shekels of silver which <strong>B </strong>paid (<em>nadānu</em>) <em>instead of </em>&nbsp;the silver that <strong>A</strong> owed to her. The final part of the text is fragmentary, only a reference to some commonly held property (<em>kar&ucirc;</em>) can be clearly identified. Names of 3 witnesses (including 2 courtiers, <em>rē&scaron; &scaron;arri</em>) and the scribe: Bulṭāya/Rēmūtu//Pahāru.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-u&scaron;allim/Zēria//Nabāya; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Silim-I&scaron;tar/Kurigalzu//&Scaron;a-nā&scaron;i&scaron;u"
