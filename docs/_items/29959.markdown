paraphrase: "Scribal exercise.<br /> The tablet is undated and most likely a scribal exercise. Its content does not seem to have been extracted from an original document; at the end of the text one reads the verb &ldquo;has received&rdquo;. The text mentions the storage area (<em>karammu</em>) on the Sin Canal and the following individuals: <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, both officials in charge of the brewery (<em>rab &scaron;ikari</em>), <strong>C</strong>, the royal skipper and <strong>D</strong>, the royal overseer of the quay. The text is not dated.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iqūpu/Bēl-iddin//&hellip;, <em>rab &scaron;ikari</em>; <strong>B</strong> = Nādinu/Bēl-iddin//Rē&#39;i-sīs&ecirc;, <em>rab &scaron;ikari</em>; <strong>C</strong> = Aplāya/ &Scaron;umu-uṣur; <strong>D</strong> = Rēmanni-ilī"
