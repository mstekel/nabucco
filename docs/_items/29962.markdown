paraphrase: "Court order.<br /> The document is related to 1;0.1 sq. kor (c. 13950 m<sup>2</sup>) of land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>) in the meadowland (<em>ugāru</em>) of Qalūnu, in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Kutha. <strong>A </strong>bought (<em>&scaron;&acirc;mu</em>) it from<strong> B </strong>for its full price (<em>ana kasap gamirtu</em>, lit. &ldquo;for the entire (sum of) silver&rdquo;): he is entitled (<em>uzzuzu </em>&Scaron;) to (that) field (<em>eqlu</em>) and enjoyes (<em>akālu</em>) its yield (<em>ebūru</em>). Then, he gave 20 shekels of silver to <strong>B </strong>and took as a pledge (<em>ma&scaron;kanu ṣabātu</em>) the rest (<em>rēhtu</em>) of the land. Then a dispute arose. As long as the case (<em>dibbu</em>) about the sale (<em>mahīru</em>) and the pledge (<em>ma&scaron;kanu</em>) of this land has not been settled (<em>qat&ucirc;</em>), <strong>B</strong> will not sell (<em>ana kaspi nadānu</em>) [&hellip;] or anything from his usufruct share (<em>zittu</em>), he will not give anything out as a gift (<em>&scaron;iriktu &scaron;arāku</em>) nor will he bestow it as a present (<em>rīmūtu r&acirc;mu</em>). He will not take up (<em>leq&ucirc;</em>) additional expenses (<em>nishu</em>) or interest-free loans (<em>hubuttūtu</em>) for this land. Names of 6 judges and 2 scribes.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Zēria/Nergal-uballiṭ//Sagdidi"
