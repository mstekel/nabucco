paraphrase: "Loan <em>ina pāni</em><br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 10;3.2 kor barley (c. 1890 liters) to <strong>A</strong>. The latter is introduced by his first name, &Scaron;irku, without genealogy, and is probably to be identified with Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-marduk-balāṭu, aka &Scaron;irku, head of the Egibi family. The document does not relate to when or where <strong>B</strong> should return the barley which is at his disposal (<em>ina pāni</em>). Names of 4 witnesses, who are introduced by the fomula <em>ina u&scaron;uzzi &scaron;a</em> &quot;in the presence of&quot;, followed by the name of the scribe (Bēl-iddin/Ardia//Bēl-aplu-uṣur) and two more names (additional witnesses?).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi (&Scaron;​irku, without genealogy); <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-bullissu/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-uṣur//Bēl-aplu-uṣur"
