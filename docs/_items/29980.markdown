paraphrase: "Addendum to a slave sale.<br /> <strong>A</strong> sold a female slave to <strong>B </strong>for 1 1/3 mina of silver (cf. BM30911): the buyer already paid 1 mina of silver to <strong>A</strong> and his mother (<strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong>) at the occasion of his purchase of their plot of land located on the Zabūnu ditch. Apparently, this land sale did eventually not materialize, as goes forth from a fragmentarily preserved passage, so that the 1 mina that was paid will be credited to <strong>B</strong> for his purchase of the slave (see also BM30911). (As for) the rest (of the silver): (as soon as) <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong>&lsquo;s name will be included in <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>&rsquo;s sale document (<em>ina ṭuppi</em>), <strong>B</strong> will announce the (slave&#39;s?) market value (<em>māhiru </em>[&hellip;] <em>&scaron;em&ucirc;</em> &Scaron;) (partly uncl.) and will pay the remaining 1/3 mina to <strong>A</strong>. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-&scaron;umu-ibni/&scaron;umu-ukīn//Ile&rsquo;&rsquo;i-bulliṭ-Marduk; <strong>B</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = <sup>f</sup>&Scaron;idatu; <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ka&scaron;&scaron;āya, mother of <strong>A</strong>"
