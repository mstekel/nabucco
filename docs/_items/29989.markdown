paraphrase: "Summon<br /> By Kislīm (IX), 1<sup>st</sup>,&nbsp; <strong>A</strong> will present his witness in Opis. He will witness against <strong>B</strong>, (maintaining) that <strong>C</strong>, who acted as guarantor through <strong>B</strong>, at the established date [...] took the contract away (and) gave it to <strong>B</strong>. If he will be able to bring his testimony, he will go unpunished. Should he fail to present his witness, he must pay to <strong>B </strong>what is written in the promissory note, both the barley and its interests. Names of 2 witnesses. Scribe: Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> A = Gudāya/Hinni-ilī//Mar-ban&ecirc;; B = Bāba-ēre&scaron;/Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-apli; C = Katimu&rsquo;/Hagūru"
