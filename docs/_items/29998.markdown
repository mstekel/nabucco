paraphrase: "Settlement of accounts.<br /> The tablet records the settlement of the accounts (<em>epu&scaron; nikkassi</em>) of a business in first-draft beer (<em>&scaron;ikaru re&scaron;t&ucirc;</em>) for the 13<sup>th</sup> year of Nabonidus. It is chiefly concerned with the silver sums and beer vats that have been&nbsp; available to <strong>A</strong>. He had two major sums of silver at his disposal (<em>ina pani</em>). First, 2 minas and 52 &frac12; shekels of silver of which at the time of recording the present document remain 16 &frac12; shekels, the rest having been spent as specified in the present document. The second sum amounts to 2 minas and 55 &frac12; shekels of silver: its various components are specified in the present document.<br /> The first lines list amounts of beer vats and silver, including 24(?) vats of full-strength beer (<em>&scaron;ikaru ṭābu</em>), out of which 11 vats x x (uncl.)&nbsp; what remains &nbsp;(<em>rēhtu</em>) <em>of the </em>x x x (uncl.) vat(s) for 2 minas and 52 &frac12; &nbsp;shekels of silver.x x x (uncl.) the &frac12;&nbsp; mina that had been paid (<em>man&ucirc;</em>). The said amount (of 2 minas and 52 &frac12; shekels) at <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s disposal (<em>ina pāni</em>) does not include (<em>elat</em>) the 2 minas and 15 shekels of silver (over which he disposes) since Ulūl (VI) of Nabonidus&rsquo; 13<sup>th</sup> regnal year.<br /> From those 2 minas and 52 &frac12; shekels <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> (received) 56 shekels and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> (received) 6 &frac12; shekels, so that together they owe 1 mina and 2 &frac12; shekels of silver to <strong>C</strong>, (plus) 1 1/3 mina and 4 &frac12; shekels ... (remnants of signs, uncl.) (and) apart from (<em>elat</em>) 7 shekels of silver which are due to <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> and 6 shekels due to(?)&nbsp;<strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong>. In total, (<strong>A</strong> spent) 2 &frac12; minas and 6 shekels of silver (of the 2 minas and 52 &frac12; shekels that were at his disposal); what remains (<em>rēhtu</em>) therefore at <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s disposal (<em>ina pāni </em>A) are 16 &frac12; shekels of silver.<br /> Then, the text lists 2 minas and 15 shekels of paid (<em>man&ucirc;</em>) silver, (that have been at <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s disposal) since Ulūl (VI) of Nabonidus&rsquo; 13<sup>th</sup> regnal year, 16 &frac12; minas of previous (<em>mahr&ucirc;</em>)<em> ṭuhh&ucirc;-</em>silver, 1/3 mina and 4 shekels of previous (<em>mahr&ucirc;</em>)<em> ṭuhh&ucirc;-</em>silver due to <strong>A</strong> and his wife <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong>, and 50 vats (<em>dannu</em>) of good quality beer. In total, 2 minas and 55 &frac12; shekels of silver and 50 vats of good quality beer are at <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s disposal (<em>ina pāni</em>). This total does not include (<em>elat</em>) empty jars (<em>dannu rīqū</em>) and household goods (<em>ud&ecirc; bīti</em>). The document was drafted in the presence of (<em>ina u&scaron;uzzi</em>) <strong>F<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>F<sub>2</sub></strong><sub>.</sub><br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-uterri; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nādinu/Ina-ṣilli-Bēl; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Padāya/Hanunu; <strong>C</strong> = Nādinu/Padāya; <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-uṣur (without affiliation); <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong> = Laba&scaron;i/Bēl-reṣua; <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Miṣātu, wife of A; <strong>F<sub>1</sub></strong> = Marduk-balāssu-iqbi/Nab&ucirc;-zēru-iddin//Dābibi; <strong>F<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-uballiṭ/Nab&ucirc;-aplu-iddin//Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;"
