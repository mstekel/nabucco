paraphrase: "Establishment of a business partnership.<br /> <strong>A</strong> invests 6 minas of silver in a business partnership (<em>harrānu</em>) with <strong>B</strong>.<br /> The partners agree that <strong>A</strong> is entitled (<em>akālu</em>) to a share in the profits (<em>utru</em>) that equals <strong>B</strong>&#39;s (<em>ahu zitti</em>).&nbsp; <strong>B</strong> will do business in and out of town (<em>ālu u ṣēru</em>).<br /> This silver is what remains (<em>rīhtu</em>) to be paid by <strong>B</strong> from the originally 11 minas of silver which A invested in the business six years earlier, in Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s 24<sup>th</sup> year. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Ēṭiru/Nab&ucirc;-upahhir//Ile&#39;&#39;i-bulluṭa-Marduk.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/L&acirc;bā&scaron;i-Marduk//Ile&#39;&#39;i-bulluṭa-Marduk; <strong>B</strong> = Kāṣir/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n&nbsp;"
