paraphrase: "Share-farming agreement for a cow<br /> The text is related to a brown cow, marked with the signs UD-<em>tu-&uacute;</em> on its front-right thigh and on its back-thigh (<em>ṭurru</em>): <strong>A</strong> gives it to <strong>B</strong> in return for a share (<em>ana zitti</em>) in the profits from its labour, estimated at 50 shekels of white silver, of which 1/8 is alloy. The two parties agree that they are both responsible for the milk products (<em>i&scaron;kurratu</em>) and the fodder supply (<em>tablittu</em>). <strong>B </strong>guarantees for the cow&rsquo;s pasturing, caretaking, and &nbsp;guarding (lit. &lsquo;not escaping&rsquo;), day and night. <strong>A</strong> acknowledges that he received from <strong>B</strong> the silver, a front-end payment for his half share. The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each. Names of witness and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-zēru-ibni/Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu/Egibi&nbsp;"
