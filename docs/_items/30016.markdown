paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases land from <strong>B</strong>: given its irregular surface area, it was divided into three portions (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>). All the neighbouring properties on each side are recorded in the first lines of the text, however this information is lost because of the damaged condition of the tablet. Only the property adjacent to third portion&#39;s lower front in the East is known: it is adjacent to (the property) of <strong>C</strong>. <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent for this land together with the seller <strong>B</strong>, 3 Kor (40500 m<sup>2</sup>) in total, to be 14 shekels of silver per 0;0.1 Kor (450 m<sup>2</sup>) (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>). He pays the total purchase price of 21 minas, plus 40 shekels as additional payment (<em>k&icirc; p&icirc; atri</em>). <strong>B </strong>acknowledges that he has received (<em>mahāru</em>) in total 21 minas and 40 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), and he is satisfied. The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. One final sentence, written after the date and only partially readable, mentions a purchase price (<em>mahīru</em>) and again a date &ndash; but it is not possible to say to which deal this formula is referring to. 9 witnesses (names lost) and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = &Scaron;umu-iddin/&Scaron;āpik-zēri//Nabāya; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-zēru-iqī&scaron;a"
