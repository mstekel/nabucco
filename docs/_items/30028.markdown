paraphrase: "Interim settlement of accounts, within the framework of a business partnership.<br /> Three business partners divide the profits of their partnership in three equal shares as agreed (<em>aki zitti&scaron;unu</em>).<strong> A</strong> receives (<em>mahāru</em>)&nbsp; 1 mina of silver, his one-third share in the profits of the business partnership that he owns together with <strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong>. The silver is what had been paid to the partners in installments (<em>&scaron;a ina m&icirc;ni&scaron;u mahāru</em>) while trading their onions (<em>ana &scaron;ūmi</em>). <strong>B</strong>&nbsp; receives (<em>mahāru</em>) the 1 mina of silver that had been recorded in his tablet (<em>ina ṭuppi &scaron;akānu</em>). <strong>C</strong> can take (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) the 1 mina of silver that is about to arrive (<em>erēbu</em>).&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Ea-nāṣir(/Mu&scaron;allim//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Nanāya); <strong>C</strong> = Marduk-ēṭir&nbsp;"
