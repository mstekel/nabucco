Should he not come, he will pay the 6 shekels of silver (that he owes) to <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong>, without (<em>&scaron;a lā</em>) [&hellip; uncl.). He will return (<em>t&acirc;ru</em>) everything that he has [&hellip;] from the hands of <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> [...]. <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> guarantees for the (re)payment (<em>eṭēru</em>) of the silver and barley.
