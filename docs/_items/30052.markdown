Additional securities are in place: on part of this debt, namely 26 shekels, the debtors will have to pay a yearly interest of 20%, to be paid on a monthly basis. The remaining 10 shekels is interest-free as it is secured by the pledge in antichresis of the east part of the debtors&#39; house (&quot;no rent on the house, and no interest on the silver&quot;).&nbsp; Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe: <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>.
