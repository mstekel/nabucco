paraphrase: "Settlement of accounts.<br /> On the day when <strong>A </strong>comes and draws up the accounts (<em>nikkassu epē&scaron;u</em>) with <strong>B</strong>, <strong>B</strong> will pay (<em>nadānu</em>) the amount of silver which has been charged (<em>el&ucirc;</em>) to him, capital and interest (<em>kaspu u hubullu</em>). The silver, as much as (is needed for) the settlement of accounts, is charged (<em>el&ucirc;</em>) to <strong>A</strong>. <strong>C</strong> will pay (<em>nadānu</em>) the capital and interest (<em>kaspu u hubullu</em>) for this debt. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe: Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;...&scaron;ari; <strong>B</strong> = Arad-Bēl; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-bēl&scaron;unu"
