paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> The tablet records the purchase of agricultural land which, given its irregular shape, is calculated according to seven different measured areas: each one of these smaller plots is described separately, marked on the tablet by a line drawn at the end of each paragraph (and indicated below in the paraphrase by LINE).<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> und <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> purchase 1 kor (13500 m<sup>2</sup>) agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) from <strong>B</strong>: this consists of a date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) located in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>), cultivated with big as well as young date palms (<em>tālu</em>), in front of the Zababa Gate in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon. LINE<br /> 1) The first area (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>) measures 0;2.0.5.2+x Kor (5790+ m<sup>2</sup>) in total. Its upper side in the West is 700 cubits (350 m) long and it borders on some property whose details are lost, the second measured area listed below (<em>libbū eqli</em>) , and the field of <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>; its lower side in the East, which has the same length as the upper side, borders on (the property of) <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> und <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>. Its upper front in the North is 35 cubits (17,5 m) long and borders on the royal street (<em>harrān &scaron;arri</em>) along the bank (<em>ki&scaron;ādu</em>) of the Banītu-Canal; its lower front in the South is 32 2/3 cubits (c. 16,5 m) long and it borders on the next measured area.<br /> 2) The second area (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>) measures 0;0.5.5 Kor (2625 m<sup>2</sup>) in total. Its upper side in the West, 300 cubits (150 m) long, borders on a plot of 0.0.0.5.6 2/3 Kor (425 m<sup>2</sup>) with x cubits long short sides, and on the property of <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>, mother of <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong>; its lower side in the East, which has the same length as the upper side borders on the property of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> und <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>. Its upper front in the North, 32 2/3 cubits (c. 16,3 m) long, borders on the first plot, an unknown amount of cubits of its lower front in the South borders on the next measured area (<em>libbū eqli</em>). LINE<br /> 3) The surface of the third measured area (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>) is lost in a lacuna. Its long sides are 300 cubits (150 m) long and border on the property of <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> in the West and on the land of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> in the East. The front sides, whose lengths are also lost, are adjacent to the second plot in the North and to the next measured area (<em>libbu eqli</em>) in the South. LINE<br /> 4) The fourth measured area (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>), of an unknown size, has the same lengths and neighbours for the long sides: 300 cubits (150 m), <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> in the West, and <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> in the East. Its upper front side in the North is 20 2/3 cubits (c. 10,3 m) long and borders on the previous (third) measured area, while its lower front in the South, 16 1/2 cubits (c. 8,25 m) long, borders on the measured area (<em>libbū eqli</em>). LINE<br /> 5) The surface area of the fifth plot (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>) is also lost in a lacuna. Its long sides are 300 cubits (150 m) long and border on the property of <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> in the West and on the land of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> in the East. The upper front in the North, 16 1/2 cubits (c. 8,25 m) long, is adjacent to the previous (fourth) plot in the North; its lower front side in the South is 10 cubits (5 m) long and borders on the next plot (<em>libbū eqli</em>). LINE<br /> 6) The sixth measured area (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>), whose size is lost in a lacuna, has once again the same lengths and neighbours for its long sides: 300 cubits (150 m), <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> in the West, and <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> in the East. Its upper front side in the North is 10 cubits (5 m) long and is adjacent to the previous (fifth) measured area, while the lower front side in the South borders on the next plot. LINE<br /> 7) The last measured area (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>), of unknown size, has shorter sides. The long ones measure 250 cubits (125 m) and border once again on <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> in the West, and <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> in the East &ndash; while its upper front in the North is adjacent to the previous (sixth) plot. LINE<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> declare the equivalent for this land together with the seller <strong>B</strong> (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>) to be 1 shekel each X kor of land (the exact amount is lost in a lacuna of the tablet). From a broken passage it is possible to infer that the buyers have given (<em>nadānu</em>) some minas and shekels of silver corresponding to the entire purchase price (<em>&scaron;īmi&scaron;u gamrūtu</em>) of this field, plus more silver as additional payment (<em>k&icirc; atri</em>). LINE<br /> The seller acknowledge that he has received the full amount of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), and he is satisfied (<em>apālu </em>&nbsp;G Stat). The following lines, in fragmentary condition, must have recorded the warranty clause against future claims between the parties or members of their families. Names of 5 witnesses and 2 scribes. The exact measurements of each plot of land are recorded in BM30933.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nergal-Bān&ucirc;nu/Ṣillāya//Rab-ban&ecirc;; <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-uṣur/Nab&ucirc;-kuzub-ilī//Rab-ban&ecirc;; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = <sup>f</sup>&Scaron;ahundu /&hellip;, mother of <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong>; <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-etel-ilī; <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-uṣur-napi&scaron;ti"
