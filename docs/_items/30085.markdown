paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> The tablet records the purchase of agricultural land; the text has been divided into paragraphs, marked on the tablet by a line drawn at the end of each one (and indicated below in the paraphrase by LINE).<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases 2 Kor (27000 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>) from <strong>B</strong>. It consists partly of a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) bearing fruit (<em>iṣṣi bilti</em>), and partly (<em>adi</em>) of wasteland (<em>zēru ki&scaron;ubb&ucirc;</em>). It is located above and below the royal street&nbsp; in Litamu, in front of the Ura&sect;-Tor, in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon. LINE<br /> Its upper side in the North borders on the land which was part of the dowry (<em>zēru nudunn&ucirc;</em>) of <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong>, the buyer&#39;s wife; its lower side in the South borders on the ditch (<em>harru</em>) of the Ilutilati family and near (the property of) the sons of <strong>E</strong>. Its upper front in the West borders on (the property of) <strong>F</strong> and its lower front in the East on the Euphrates. No side lengths are given in the record. LINE<br /> The land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>), 1;3.2 Kor (22500 m<sup>2</sup>), is sold for 11 shekels per (<em>k&icirc;</em>) 0;0.1 Kor (450 m<sup>2</sup>) of land &ndash; and the wasteland (<em>zēru ki&scaron;ubb&ucirc;</em>), 0.1.4 Kor (4500 m<sup>2</sup>), is sold for 1 shekel per (<em>k&icirc;</em>) 0;0.1 Kor (450 m<sup>2</sup>) of land. Thus the total value (<em>&scaron;uqultu</em>) of the orchard is 9 minas and 10 shekels, and the total value of the wasteland is 10 shekels. <strong>A</strong> declares its equivalent together with the seller <strong>B</strong> (<em>itti</em> B A <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>) to be 9 minas and 20 shekels of silver for its total price, plus&nbsp; 10 shekels of silver as additional price <em>(ki atri</em>). LINE<br /> <strong>B</strong> acknowledges that he has received (<em>mahāru</em>) 9 minas and 30 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>) from <strong>A</strong>, the price (<em>&scaron;īmu</em>) for his field, and he is satisfied (<em>apālu </em>&nbsp;G Stat). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. An additional clause states that <strong>A</strong> did not use any silver from <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s (i.e. his father&rsquo;s) assets for the purchase. Fingernail impressions (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller <strong>B</strong> instead of his seal impression (<em>kunukku</em>). Names of 6 witnesses and a scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Kalbāya/Ṣillāya//Nabāya; <strong>C</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Amat-Bāba; <strong>E</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ittannu; <strong>F</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;allim/Abu-ul-īde"
