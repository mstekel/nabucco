paraphrase: "Purchase of land by proxy.<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchased 4 Kor (54000 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) from <strong>B, </strong>on the 24<sup>th</sup> Ta&scaron;rīt (VII) of Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s 3rd year (see BM32849 and its duplicate BM30338). The land consists of a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) along the bank (<em>ki&scaron;ādu</em>) of the Banītu-Canal, in front of (<em>mehrat</em>) the Zababa Gate in the district (<em>pīḫatu</em>) of Babylon. For this land, <strong>A </strong>gave 21 minas and 20 shekels of silver (including the additional payment (<em>atru</em>)) to <strong>B</strong>, and he sealed the sale tablet in his own name Several months later (the tablet is dated to 14<sup>th</sup> Intercalary Addar (XII<sub>2</sub>) of the same year), he concludes the deal with <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> on whose behalf he bought the land, acting as their &nbsp;proxy (<em>ina na&scaron;parti</em>). The rest of the reverse and the beginning of the obverse are broken, only the final lines of the document are extant. These establish that should a duplicate (<em>gabr&ucirc;</em>) of the original document related to the purchase of the land be found in <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s house or anywhere else, this belongs to <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>. The two buyers also confirm that they are entitled to equal shares (<em>ahāta</em>) in the land. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Kabti-ilī-Marduk/Nab&ucirc;-tabni-uṣur//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-uṣur/Nab&ucirc;-kuzub-ilī//Rabi-ban&ucirc;; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Bānūnu/Ṣillāya//Rab-ban&ecirc;; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi"
