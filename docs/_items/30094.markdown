paraphrase: "Court order?<br /> It concerns the land in the meadowland (<em>ugāru</em>) of Qalūnu, in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Kutha which <strong>A</strong> purchased from <strong>B</strong>: he is entitled (<em>uzzuzu </em>&Scaron;) to (that) field (<em>eqlu</em>) and enjoyes (<em>akālu</em>) its yield (<em>ebūru</em>). Then, he gave 20 shekels of silver to <strong>B </strong>and took as a pledge (<em>ma&scaron;kanu ṣabātu</em>) the rest (<em>rēhtu</em>) of the land. Then a dispute arose. Remainder broken off. This tablet is perhaps a duplicate copy of RCT22 (= Wunsch 2000, 4).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B</strong>= Zēria/Nergal-uballiṭ//Sagdidi"
