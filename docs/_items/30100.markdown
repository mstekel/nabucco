paraphrase: "IS THE PARAPHRASE OF DAR 395//DAR 396<br /> Establishment of a business partnership (<em>harranu</em>).<br /> <strong>A</strong>&nbsp;invests 100 kor of dates, 50 kor of barley (and) 60 pieces of empty barrels in a business partnership with his slave&nbsp;<strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>. The parties agree that&nbsp;<strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>&nbsp;can divide (<em>ahata&scaron;unu</em>) whatever they make in or out of town with the said dates and barley between them, as long as they pay&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>&nbsp;yearly a fixed sum of&nbsp; 2 minas of silver. The document states further that the dates and barley stay at their disposal for three years. During this three-year period&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>&nbsp;cannot collect house rent from them. In the beginning of the third year, they should deliver the dates, the barley and the barrels without interest to&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>&nbsp;in Bīt-Hahhuru. Names of 6 witnesses, the scribe: Ubār//&Scaron;a-nā&scaron;ī&scaron;u (=&nbsp;<strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>), and 4 additional witnesses (mentioned after the date). The 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;additional witness&rsquo; patrinomy could not be copied by the scribe, hence he noted &ldquo;broken&rdquo; (<em>hep&ucirc;</em>). His name is preserved in the BM30371 (= Dar 396).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong>&nbsp;= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi;&nbsp;<strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ayyālu, slave of&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>;&nbsp;<strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>&nbsp;= Ubār/Ina-tē&scaron;&ecirc;-ēṭir//&Scaron;a-nā&scaron;ī&scaron;u"
