paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> The tablet records the purchase of agricultural land; the text has been divided into paragraphs, marked on the tablet by a line drawn at the end of each one (and indicated below in the paraphrase by LINE).<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> purchase 0;1 Kor (2700 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) located in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>) from <strong>B</strong>: it is a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) bearing fruit (<em>iṣṣi bilti</em>), located in the meadowland (<em>ugār</em>) of the Bitqu-&scaron;a-Ile&rsquo;&rsquo;i-Bēl in front of the Zababa Gate in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon. LINE<br /> Its lower side in the West, 432 cubits (216 m) long, borders on (the property of) the buyer <strong>B </strong>and the lower side in the East, with the same length, borders on (the property of) <strong>C</strong> and his brothers. The upper front in the North, 25 cubits (12,5 m) long, borders again on (the property of) <strong>B</strong>, and the lower front in the South, with the same length, is also adjacent to (the property of) <strong>B</strong>. In total, the area (<em>mi&scaron;ihti</em>) of this field is 0;1 Kor (2700 m<sup>2</sup>). LINE<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> declare the equivalent for this land together with the seller <strong>B</strong> (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>) to be 1 shekel of silver for each 0;0.0.0.6 Kor (45 m<sup>2</sup>). They pay (<em>nadānu</em>) the seller 1 mina of silver as total purchase price (<em>&scaron;īmi&scaron;u gamrūtu</em>), plus 3 shekels of silver as additional payment (<em>k&icirc; atri</em>). The total, thus, amounts to 1 mina and 3 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>).<br /> <strong>B</strong> acknowledges that he has received (<em>mahāru</em>) the total amount of silver corresponding to the purchase price of his field, and he is satisfied (<em>apālu </em>&nbsp;G Stat). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. The royal scribes will put the agreement down in writing (<em>&scaron;aṭāru</em>) and give the document to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>, in order to make sure that it will not be changed in the future. Fingernail impressions (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller <strong>B</strong>, instead of his seal impression (<em>kunukku</em>). At the end of the tablet, <strong>B </strong>promises that he will not withhold (<em>kal&ucirc;</em>) water from <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>. Names of 6 witnesses (including <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong>, <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s wife) and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub> </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>A<sub>2</sub> </strong>= Rēmūtu/Kurbanni-Marduk//Ea-eppe&scaron;; <strong>B</strong> = Nergal-iddin/Nab&ucirc;-kāṣir//Eppe&scaron;-ilī; <strong>C</strong> = Balāṭu/&hellip;-u&scaron;ab&scaron;i;<strong> <sup>f</sup>D</strong> = Nuptāya, wife of <strong>B</strong>"
