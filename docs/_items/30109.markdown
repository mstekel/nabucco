paraphrase: "Settlement of a silver debt by selling a house.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 5/6 minas of silver to <strong>A<sub>1 </sub></strong>and sold his house to <strong>C</strong> (in order to raise the silver needed to pay off his debt) (<em>ana kaspi mahāru</em>, lit. &ldquo;C bought for silver&rdquo;). The debt was a claim (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) for building plots (<em>qan&ucirc;</em>) which the original creditor had transferred (<em>pāni &scaron;udgulu</em>) to the (present) creditor (<em>ra&scaron;ūtānu</em>).&nbsp; It had been agreed that 1/3 minas of the purchase price should be used to pay off (<em>eṭēru</em> N) the creditor (<em>akī ra&scaron;ūtāni</em>). In the present document, the creditor&rsquo;s son&nbsp; (<strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>) acknowledges his receipt (<em>eṭēru</em>) of the said sum of silver from <strong>D</strong>, who acted as proxy on behalf (<em>ina na&scaron;parti</em>) of <strong>C</strong>, the buyer of (<strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s) house. <strong>E</strong>&nbsp;guarantees for the payment of the 1/3 minas of silver as long as&nbsp;<strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>&nbsp;has not informed (<em>qab&ucirc;</em>) the royal scribes (<em>ṭup&scaron;arru &scaron;a &scaron;arri</em>) and made out a sealed tablet certifying full payment (<em>ṭuppi apiltu</em>). Furthermore,&nbsp;<strong>A<sub>2 </sub></strong>gives&nbsp;<strong>C</strong> the promissory note (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) for the 2/3 minas of silver which <strong>B</strong> owed to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> (and which<strong> C</strong> apparently paid for). Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Bēl-zēru-ibni/&Scaron;āpik-zēri//Nappāhu; <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = Marduk-aplu-uṣur/Bēl-zēru-ibni//Nappāhu, son of Bēl-zēru-ibni/&Scaron;āpik-zēri//Nappāhu; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-aplu-iddin/Balāṭu//&Scaron;a-nā&scaron;ī&scaron;u; <strong>C</strong> = Neriglissar/Bēl-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun; <strong>D</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>E</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-bulliṭ/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-iddin//Ea-pattanu"
