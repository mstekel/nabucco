paraphrase: "Promissory oath about debt repayment<br /> <strong>B </strong>swears (<em>tam&ucirc;</em>) by Bēl, Nab&ucirc; and king Darius to <strong>A</strong>: &quot;Until (<em>adi</em>) the 15<sup>th</sup> day of Ṭebēt (X) of Darius&rsquo; 11<sup>th</sup> year I will bring and hand over (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc; &ndash; nadānu</em>) the 8 kor (c. 1440 liters) of barley, the 34 kor (c. 6120 liters) of dates and the 13 shekels of silver that I owe you to your slave <strong>C</strong>.&quot; The payment is secured by the pledge (<em>ma&scaron;kanu &scaron;akānu</em>) of <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s slave<strong> D </strong>to <strong>C</strong>. Should <strong>B </strong>fail to meet the deadline, his slave <strong>D </strong>will belong (<em>dagālu</em>) henceforth to <strong>A, </strong>for its exact price (<em>&scaron;īm hariṣ</em>), in lieu of the 34 kor dates and the 13 shekels of silver, and he should deliver the indebted 8 kor of barley to <strong>A</strong> according to (<em>akī</em>) Babylon&rsquo;s market value (<em>mahīru</em>). If he meets the deadline and accordingly delivers the barley, dates and silver on the 15<sup>th</sup> day, he will be allowed to take along (<em>abāku</em>) his slave <strong>D</strong>. <strong>B</strong> swears by Bēl, Nab&ucirc; and king Darius to <strong>A</strong>: &quot;The deadline (<em>adannu</em>) of the promissory note (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) will not be missed (<em>etēqu</em>).&rdquo; At this point in the story, it is pointed out that 14 kor of dates and 16 kor of barley have already been delivered (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>, G. Stat.), and that a warranty (<em>pūtu</em>) for <strong>B</strong> and the 13 shekels of silver has been arranged (<em>&scaron;akānu</em>, G. Stat.) as well as a warranty that guarantees (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;) </em>for the words spoken by (<em>ana pī</em>) <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s father (erroneously wr. <sup>I</sup>mu-<sup>d</sup>u.gur, Iddin-Nergal for Nergal-iddin). Names of 10 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= Ardia/Nergal-iddin;<strong> C </strong>= Madānu-iddin, slave (<em>qallu</em>) of <strong>A</strong>; <strong>D </strong>= Nergal-bulliṭanni, slave (<em>qallu</em>) of <strong>B</strong>."
