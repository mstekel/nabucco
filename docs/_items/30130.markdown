paraphrase: "Receipt for silver: separate payment for yield.<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> receive (<em>eṭeru</em>) silver (the exact amount is not recorded in the text) from <strong>B</strong>, who previously purchased (<em>mahīra epē&scaron;u</em>) a plot of arable land (<em>zēru</em>) situaled along <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s sluice channel (<em>bitqu</em>) from them. This is the price for the yield (<em>ebūru</em>) of that date palm grove for Cyrus 7<sup>th</sup> year. The related text BM32204 (Wunsch 2000, 70) shows that the land which <strong>B</strong> bought was an orchard planted with date palms: since the purchase took place shortly before the date harvest, the buyer must pay separately for it. Names of 2 witnesses (including Nab&ucirc;-kuzub-ilī/&Scaron;ūzubu/&Scaron;ig&ucirc;a, brother of <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>1</sub></strong>) and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ta&scaron;mētu-damqat/&Scaron;ūzubu//&Scaron;ig&ucirc;a; <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nādin/Rēmūt//Eppe&scaron;-ilī; <strong>B </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Ile&rsquo;&rsquo;i-Bēl"
