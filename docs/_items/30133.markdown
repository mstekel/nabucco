paraphrase: "Transfer of ownership, subject to life interest<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong>, of her own free will (<em>ina hūd libbi&scaron;u</em>), has transferred the ownership of her properties (<em>nikkassu</em>) located inside and outside the city to her daughter <strong><sup>f</sup>B </strong>under a sealed document (<em>kanāku </em>- <em>dagālu </em>&Scaron;). The transferred amount does not include 5 minas of silver, 2 slaves (<em>amīlūtu</em>) and household goods (<em>ud&ecirc; bīti</em>), that she previously gave to <strong>C</strong> as her daughter&rsquo;s dowry (<em>nudunn&ucirc;</em>). As long as <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> will live, she will enjoy the usufruct (<em>akalu akālu</em>) of her assets. She cannot transfer the property (of anything) to anyone, on her own authority (<em>&scaron;alāṭu - nadānu</em>). The text also records that <strong><sup>f</sup>B </strong>will not give any of the properties inherited from her mother to anyone, without (the consent of) her husband, <strong>C</strong>. When <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> will die, her assets will be at <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong>&rsquo;s disposal (<em>ina pāni dagālu</em> N). The text ends invoking the gods&rsquo; curse upon whomever will change (<em>en&ucirc;</em>) the words written in this agreement (<em>dabābu</em>). Names of 6 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Silim-I&scaron;tar/Kurigalzu//&Scaron;a-nā&scaron;i&scaron;u; <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Gula-qā&rsquo;i&scaron;at, daughter of <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong>; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-u&scaron;allim/Zēria//Nabāya"
