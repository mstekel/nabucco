paraphrase: "Establishment of a business partnership.<br /> <strong>A</strong> invests 12 minas of stamped(?) silver (<em>ginnu</em> (silver) used for purchases and sales (<em>nadānu u mahāru</em>) in a business partnership with <strong>B</strong>. The partners agree that B will give (<em>nadānu</em>) an equal share (<em>ahu zitti</em>) to <strong>A</strong> in whatever he makes with the mentioned 12 minas of silver. Furthermore, the present document stipulates that <strong>B </strong>will not enter into another business partnership (<em>harrānu alāku</em>) besides (<em>elat</em>) the present one. Similarly, <strong>A</strong> does not have another business partnership (<em>ina harrāni ian&ucirc;</em>) besides the present one. <strong>B</strong> guarantees the capital sum of the mentioned silver [i.e., 12 minas] and will run the business (<em>na&scaron;partu &scaron;a harrāni alāku</em>). Names of 5 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-kāṣir/Marduk-u&scaron;allim//A&scaron;lāku"
