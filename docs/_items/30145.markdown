paraphrase: "Receipt for silver: partial repayment on a purchase of land.<br /> <strong>A</strong> receives 1 mina and 59 shekels of medium quality silver, of which 1/8 is alloy, from <strong>B</strong> as partial repayment of a debt (<em>u&lsquo;iltu</em>) of 8 minas and 10 shekels of silver. This is what remains (<em>rīhtu</em>) to be paid of the price (whose total amount is not specified) for arable land (<em>zēru</em>) that he bought from the recipient. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: <strong>B</strong>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Ea-aplu-iddin/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk//Ṭābih-kāri; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi"
