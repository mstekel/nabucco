paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases a plot of land, whose description is largely lost in the damaged upper part of the tablet, from a person whose name is also lost. The land lower side in the South borders on the buyer&rsquo;s property and (the land of) <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>; its upper front in the West borders on (the land of) <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> und <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>, and its lower front in the East on (the land of) <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong>. The total surface of the field is 0;0.1.1 Kor (525 m<sup>2</sup>); <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent of the field (<em>mahīra nab&ucirc;</em>) to be an amount of silver which is lost in a lacuna. The seller acknowledges that he has received (<em>mahāru</em>) the total amount due for the purchase of his field, and he is satisfied (<em>apālu </em>&nbsp;G Stat); the usual warranty clauses must have followed, but the tablet is broken. The names of the witnesses and the scribe are lost.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Rēmūt/Nādin//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bēl-iddin/Nādin//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Marduk-&hellip;/Nādin-ahi//Adad-&scaron;umu-ēre&scaron;; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bēl&scaron;unu/Nādin-ahi//Adad-&scaron;umu-ēre&scaron;; <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Si&hellip;/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-erība//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&hellip;"
