paraphrase: "About the purchase of land: undertaking to pay the rest of the purchase price after the acknowledgment by witnesses.<br /> <strong>A</strong> (who acts as <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s proxy, though this is not explicitly stated in the text) owes 14 1/2 shekels of silver to <strong>B</strong>. This is what remains <em>(rīhtu</em>) to be paid after <strong>C</strong> purchased 0;0.3 Kor (1350 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land, a jointly held property to which <strong>B</strong> (<em>pūt</em> <em>zittu</em>) has title and of which <strong>C </strong>and his brothers are co-owners. The buyer is afraid that members of the seller&rsquo;s family could go against this sell: thus, he asks them to be included among the witnesses of this deal. He will give the silver, 14 &frac12; shekels, to <strong>B</strong> as soon as (<em>ūmu &scaron;a</em>) the brothers of <strong>B </strong>and <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong>, the wife of <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s father, will be listed in <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s sealed document among the witnesses. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = &Scaron;āpik-zēri/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-iddin//Nādin-&scaron;e&#39;im; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-mu&scaron;ētiq-udd&ecirc;/Rēmūt//Eppe&scaron;-ilī; <strong>C</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ṭābatu, wife of <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s father"
