paraphrase: "House rental.<br /> <strong>A</strong> rents a house to <strong>B</strong> for 1/3 m 5 shekels of stamped silver (<em>ginnu</em>) per year. The house is located next to the house that belongs to three brothers (<strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong>).&nbsp; It is agreed that half of the silver should be paid at the beginning of the year, and the remainder in the middle. The renter should pay for the additional payment (<em>nūptu</em>) in Nisan (I), D&ucirc;zu (IV) and Kislim (IX). He should also carry out repairs to the house (<em>batqa ṣabātu</em>) and caulk (<em>&scaron;an&ucirc;</em>) the roof. &nbsp;<strong>A</strong> will be charged (<em>man&ucirc;</em>) for whatever work (<em>dullu</em>) that is to be done in it with bricks (<em>libnāte</em>) and reeds (<em>qan&acirc;te</em>), for maximum 2 shekels of silver. Names of 5 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddināya/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Saggilāya; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Bēl-&hellip;; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bēl-bullissu; <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong> = Nidintu"
