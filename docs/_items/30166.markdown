paraphrase: "Settlement of accounts related to a dowry.<br /> The two brothers <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and<strong> B<sub>2</sub></strong>&nbsp; haven&rsquo;t settled yet their accounts (<em>epe&scaron; nikkassi qat&ucirc;</em>). It concerns silver which <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> received (<em>ina pāni</em>, lit. is at his disposal) in lieu of (<em>kum</em>) part of his wife&rsquo;s dowry (<strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>) from his father-in-law <strong>D</strong>. It had apparently been invested in a business venture which was run by the two brothers (<em>ina muhhi</em>, lit. due from them). The explicit term for business venture, <em>harranu</em>, is not used. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: &Scaron;āpik-zēri/Zēru-ukīn//Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>D</strong>=Zēria(//Nabāya); <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>=Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>=<sup>f</sup>Ina-Esagila-rāmat, daughter of <strong>D</strong> (and wife of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>); <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>=Kāṣir (probably <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s brother)"
