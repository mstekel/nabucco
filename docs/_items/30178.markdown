paraphrase: "Litigation.<br /> The top part of the tablet is broken off; after this lacuna, the text records that someone (whose name is lost ) has shown (<em>kalāmu</em> D) something to <strong>A</strong>, who said: &ldquo;I am not <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s son. <strong>C</strong>, my father&rsquo;s brother, has adopted (<em>leq&ucirc;</em>) me. Examine (<em>bu&lsquo;&ucirc;</em>) <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s assets (<em>nikkassu</em>) and may (your claim) be fully paid (<em>&scaron;alāmu</em>)&ldquo;. <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>D<sub>3</sub></strong> listened to him together, and [&hellip;] the settlements (<em>ālu</em>) which belonged to <strong>B</strong> and his brother <strong>E</strong> [...] (text broken off, only <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s and <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s names are readable in a fragmentary passage). [...] <strong>A</strong> releases (<em>mu&scaron;&scaron;uru</em>) [&hellip;] to <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong>. They will [&hellip;] all the assets (<em>nikkassu</em>) belonging to <strong>B</strong> and <strong>E</strong>, and from them they will receive full payment (<em>&scaron;alāmu</em>) for what remains (<em>rēhtu</em>) of their credit (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) due by <strong>B</strong>. The tablet has been written in the presence of (<em>ina a&scaron;ābi</em>) <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s mother. Names of 5 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-ahhē-iddin; <strong>B</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk; <strong>C</strong> = Rēmūtu-Gula, uncle of <strong>A</strong>; <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bēl&scaron;unu; <strong>D<sub>3</sub></strong> = broken off; <strong>E</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir-nap&scaron;āti, brother of <strong>B</strong>"
