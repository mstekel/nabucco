paraphrase: "Summon. Undertaking to bring along a witness before the (business) accounts can be settled.<br /> As soon as <strong>A </strong>will have brought along (<em>abāku</em>) his witness who will testify (<em>kunnu</em>) against <strong>B</strong>, saying that<strong> A</strong> gave to <strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong> commodities (<em>mēre&scaron;tu</em>) (to the value of) 2 1/2 minas of silver, then <strong>B</strong> will do (<em>epē&scaron;u</em>) the accounts with <strong>A</strong> and [...]. Whatever share (<em>mimma pūt zitti</em>) that he has (now) at his disposal is what remains (<em>rīhu</em>), <em>each of them is <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s&nbsp;</em>(?) (1-<em>en-a B</em>) (unc.). If the witness will not testify, then <em>either he or the other one</em>(?) (<em>i&scaron;tēnu &scaron;an&ucirc;</em>) (i.e. <strong>A</strong> or the witness) will return to <strong>B </strong>(<em>tar&ucirc;</em> D &ndash; <em>nadānu</em>) whatever <strong>A</strong> took away (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;) </em>from him. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-nā&rsquo;id/Nab&ucirc;-gāmil; <strong>B</strong> = Aia-ahhāya/&Scaron;aniāma; <strong>C</strong> = Baruhi-ilu"
