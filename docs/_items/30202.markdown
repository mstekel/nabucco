paraphrase: "Receipt(?) for silver. Very fragmentary.<br /> The tablet records an amount of silver which is lost in a lacuna at the beginning of the first line: this is what remains (<em>rēhtu</em>) (to be paid) from the purchase price (<em>&scaron;īmu</em>) for a plot of land. <strong>A</strong> has <em>received</em> (the verb is lost in a lacuna) from <strong>B</strong>. Rest broken off. Wunsch 2000, 188 suggests to consider <strong>B</strong> a proxy for Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi, and include this tablet in the Egibi archive. Names of witnesses broken off, only part of the affiliation of the scribe is readable: [&hellip;]//Bā&rsquo;iru.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> A = &Scaron;ama&scaron;-aplu-uṣur / &sect;ama&sect;inate&sect;ie#er/ &sect;angu&sect;ama&sect;; B= .../...-mu&scaron;ētiq-udd&ecirc;//Mudammiq-Adad (Probably: Gūzānu/Nab&ucirc;-mu&scaron;ētiq-udd&ecirc;//Mudammiq-Adad, cf. BM30868 and BM33912)."
