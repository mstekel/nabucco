paraphrase: "Fixation of interest and pledge of a slave as securities for silver debts<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 10 &frac12; shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>, on which he should pay a yearly interest of 20% on a monthly. In addition, there is earlier promissory note for 1 mina and 34 shekels of silver between the same parties on which B is paying interest since Nisan (I) of Nabonidus&rsquo; 11<sup>th</sup> year. The payment of the both debts is secured by the pledge of the debtor&rsquo;s slave (<strong>C</strong>).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B </strong>= Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl/Zēria//Nabāya; <strong>C </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;ēzib, slave of <strong>B</strong>"
