paraphrase: "Establishment of a business partnership.<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> invest 24;2.0.0 kor barley, worth 56 shekels of silver, in a business partnership with <strong>B</strong>, whom they regard accountable for this sum (<em>ana muhhi man&ucirc;</em>) and to whom they granted a half share in it (<em>ahu zitti &scaron;akānu</em>). C is identified as the person who actually owes the barley to the partners. It is agreed that they will together collect it from him (<em>lapāni esēru</em>). <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> will be fully paid for their investment of 56 shekels (<em>&scaron;alāmu</em> G) from the common business capital (<em>kar&ucirc;</em>) and testify (<em>pūt mukinnūti na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) that <strong>C</strong> still owes the 24;2.0.0 kor of barley, due from him for the month Kislīm (IX) from the previous year. A short remark at the end of the document qualifies the capital sum of silver as having 1/6 alloy. Names of xxx witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Kāṣir/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-ile&rsquo;&rsquo;i/&Scaron;ūzubu//Bēl-bani; <strong>C</strong> = Ubār-Nab&ucirc;/&Scaron;um-Nab&ucirc;"
