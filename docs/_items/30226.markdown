paraphrase: "About the sale of a slave: settlement of a dispute between the sellers about their shares in the purchase price.<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchased three slaves from <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and his uncle <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, for 3 1/2 minas of silver. Out of this amount, <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> should have taken 2 minas and 10 shekels, and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> the remaining 1 1/3 mina. Later, <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> brought a suit against <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> with regard to his share of the purchase price, but apparently he was not successful. In this tablet, in fact, one finds confirmation that <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> has taken possession of the 2 minas and 10 shekels of silver, his share in the purchase price. It is also stated that the two sellers <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> are the <em>u&scaron;k&ucirc;tu-</em>guarantors for the slaves, as established in the sale contract. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-iqī&scaron;a/&Scaron;ellibi//Atkuppu; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bēl- kē&scaron;ir/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi, uncle of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>"
