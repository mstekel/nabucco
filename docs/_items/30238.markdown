Should <strong>A </strong>establish the case against <strong>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>(<em>k&acirc;nu</em> D), he is clear (<em>zak&ucirc;</em>). However, if he fails to do so, he should return the 100 animals to the slave-owner as well as the income from wool (<em>gizzatu</em>) and new-borns (<em>tēlītu, </em>wr. <em>te<sup>!</sup>-lit-t&uacute;</em>). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Adnadib/DINGIR <em>ia-ha-ta</em>; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Kī-li-..., slave of D; <strong>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ṣābit-ritti, slave of D; <strong>D</strong> = Nergal-&scaron;arru-uṣur/Bēl-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun; <strong>E</strong> = Adnalu."
