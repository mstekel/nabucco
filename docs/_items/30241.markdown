paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver with antichretic pledge of a house.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 50 shekels of medium quality silver, of which one-eighth is alloy to<strong> A</strong>. The payment is secured by the pledge of the debtor&rsquo;s house located next to the houses of <strong>D</strong> and <strong>E</strong>. The creditor enjoys the usufruct of the house in lieu of receiving interest (antichresis). Accordingly, he does not pay rent for the house, and <strong>B</strong> does not pay interest on his debt until the <strong>A</strong> has been fully repaid his 50 shekels of silver. <strong>C </strong>can continue living in the house for another three years. <strong>B</strong> will be charged (<em>man&ucirc;</em>) for whatever refurbishing work (<em>dullu</em>) that <strong>C</strong> does in it with bricks (<em>libnāte</em>), reeds (<em>qan&acirc;te</em>), beams (<em>gu&scaron;ūri</em>) or doors (<em>daltu</em>). Names of 6 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Nabu-balāṭu/&Scaron;umu-ukīn//&Scaron;ig&ucirc;a; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Marduk-ēṭir (without affiliation); <strong>D</strong> = Bēl-uballiṭ; <strong>E</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahu-&hellip;"
