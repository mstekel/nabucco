paraphrase: "Receipt of rental price.<br /> <strong>B, </strong>the slave of the crown prince <strong>D</strong>, has purchased a plot of land located near (the land belonging to) <strong>C </strong>and the crown prince&rsquo;s house, from <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> (who owns it as his inheritance share (<em>pūt zitti</em>) together with his wife <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>2</sub></strong>). The established purchase price amounts to 2/3 minas and 6 shekels of silver, and is apparently paid in instalments as the text refers, in this context, to a promissory note for 1/3 mina and 5 shekels of silver. <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> acknowledges that he has received the silver for his house from <strong>B</strong>,. The field will be inspected, and a receipt which attest to the full payment (<em>ṭuppu apiltu</em>) will be sealed. The paid silver will be reimbursed according to the market value. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub> </strong>= Marduk-erība/Rēmūt//Miṣirāya;<strong> <sup>f</sup>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Bāba-ēṭirat, wife of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-rēṣūa, servant of <strong>D</strong>; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>D</strong> = Bēl-&scaron;arru-uṣur, the crown prince"
