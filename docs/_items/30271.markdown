paraphrase: "Fragment of a tablet recording the purchase of land.<br /> The purchased arable land is located along a ditch (<em>harru</em>) in front of the Ura&scaron; Gate in the district (<em>pīḫatu</em>) of Babylon. Land belonging to <strong>B</strong> is also mentioned, but in a fragmentary and unclear context. <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent for this land together with the seller (whose name is lost) to be x+40 shekels of silver. Any other information is lost since the tablet breaks at this point.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-ahhē-iqī&scaron;a/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-iddin//Nādin-&scaron;e&#39;im"
