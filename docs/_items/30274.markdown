paraphrase: "Receipt for barley<br /> <strong>A</strong> receives (<em>mahāru</em>) barley from <strong>B</strong>. This is the yield (<em>ebūru</em>) of the field from the 12<sup>th</sup> and the 13<sup>th</sup> year of Darius. Each of the partners has taken a copy of the present document. It is further pointed out that <strong>A</strong> received from <strong>B</strong> the entire purchase price (<em>mimma ina</em> <em>&scaron;īmī</em>). But it is not immediately clear whether or how this relates to the previous mentioned receipt of barley. At the end of line 11, there are signs in alphabetic script. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: <strong>A</strong>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= &Scaron;irku/Iddināya//Egibi (aka Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi); <strong>B </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-naṣir/Nādinu//Bābūtu"
