paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 2 minas of silver to <strong>A</strong> (<em>&scaron;a A ina muhhi </em>B), to be delivered in Kislīm (IX). This is what remains (<em>rīhtu</em>) to be paid for the purchase of a plot of land (<em>eqlu</em>) at the outlet (<em>bābu</em>) of the ancient Kutha canal, after it turned out that the field (<em>zēru</em>) was larger than what was calculated at the time of the sale. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe. The receipt for this silver is recorded in BM30532.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong><strong> = </strong>&Scaron;ama&scaron;-aplu-uṣur/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-ina-tē&scaron;&ecirc;-ēṭir//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;; <strong>B</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi."
