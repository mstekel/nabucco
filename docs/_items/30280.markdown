paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases two plots of land from three sisters, <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>3</sub></strong>. Some details on this land are lost because of the fragmentary condition of the tablet, but from what is extant one infers that each partial area (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>) was described according to its adjacent properties. The long side in the North of the first one was adjacent to (the property of) <strong>C<sub>1</sub> </strong>and <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong>, its side in the South to (the property of) <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong>, and its front in the East to (the property of) <strong>E</strong>. Any information on the second partial area (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>) is lost. The rest of the tablet is also in a fragmentary state, but no doubt it must have recorded that <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent for this land together with the sellers <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>3</sub></strong> (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>) and that he gave (<em>nadānu</em>) the sister an unknown amount of silver, which included both the purchase price and the additional payment. <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>3</sub></strong> acknowledge that they received the silver and they are satisfied (<em>aplā</em>): finally, the usual warranty clause against future claims or suits between the two parties or members of their families follows. Names of 7 witnesses, all of them judges (<em>dayyānu</em>), and 3 scribes.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Nadāya/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-udammiq//Ma&scaron;tuk; <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ina-Esagila-rāmat/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-udammiq//Ma&scaron;tuk; <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>3</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Bēlilitu/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-udammiq//Ma&scaron;tuk; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nergal-u&scaron;allim/...//...;<strong> <sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>&hellip;/Nab&ucirc;-zēru-ibni//Rē&#39;i-sīs&ecirc;; <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Etellitu/...//...; <strong>E</strong> = Bēl-Iqī&scaron;a/Marduk-zēru-ibni//Qaqqadānītu"
