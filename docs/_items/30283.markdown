paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> The top&nbsp; of the tablet, which recorded the size and type of the purchased land with the topographical references, is lost: the only information one gets is that one side of the purchased plot of land is adjacent to the property of <strong>A</strong>, the buyer. The total purchase price of the field is also unknown, but the established ratio is 1 shekel of silver for each 0;0.0.1? Kor (75 m<sup>2</sup>?) of land, to which the buyer adds x+1/4 shekels of silver as additional payment (<em>k&icirc; atru</em>). <strong>B</strong> acknowledges that he has received (<em>mahāru</em>) the total amount of silver which was due to him, in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), and he is satisfied (<em>apālu </em>G Stat). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. The names of the witnesses and of the scribe are lost.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-ukīn//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu"
