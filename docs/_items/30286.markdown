paraphrase: "House Rental.<br /> <strong>A</strong> rents his house located near the Marbiti-Temple to <strong>B</strong>, at a price of 1 mina and 10 shekels of silver per year plus a <em>kīnayātu</em>-gift amounting to 5 shekels of silver. It is agreed that half of the silver should be paid at the beginning of the year, and the remainder in the middle. The renter should caulk (<em>&scaron;an&ucirc;</em>) the roof and repair the wall foundations (<em>asurr&ucirc;</em>); he should also deliver 2 baskets of <em>tābīlu-</em>herbs each year. <strong>A</strong> has received (<em>eṭēru</em>) the rent for his house until the end of Abu (V) of Cambyses&rsquo; 7<sup>th</sup> regnal year from <strong>B.</strong> The house is at the renter&rsquo;s disposal from Ulūl (VI) of Cambyses&rsquo;s 6<sup>th</sup> regnal year onwards. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Padāya/Nab&ucirc;-mu&scaron;ētiq-udd&ecirc;//Pahāru"
