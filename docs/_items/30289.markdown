paraphrase: "House rental.<br /> <strong>A </strong>rents a house near <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s house, including the annexes (<em>ṭipu</em>) that he owns together with <strong>D</strong>, for a one-year period (<em>ana ṭuppi ana ṭuppi</em>) to <strong>B</strong>. The rent is fixed at 1/2 mina and 2 shekels of stamped silver (<em>ginnu</em>) used for purchases and sales (<em>nadanu u maharu</em>). It is agreed that half of the silver should be paid at the beginning of the year, and the remainder in the middle. The renter should caulk (<em>&scaron;an&ucirc;</em>) the roof and repair the wall foundations (<em>asurr&ucirc;</em>). He should also pay for the additional payment (<em>nūptu</em>) in Nisan (I), D&ucirc;zu (IV) and Kislim (IX). The house is at the renter&rsquo;s disposal from the 15<sup>th</sup> of Simān (III) onwards. <strong>D</strong> will set doors into the doorways (<em>daltu zaqāpu</em>). Should the landlord break the contract, he will have to pay an unknown amount of silver (the tablet is broken in this point). The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each. <strong>D</strong> will roof (<em>ṣullulu</em>) the rest of the annexes (<em>ṭipāni</em>); he will give them to <strong>B</strong>. Names of 6 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-ēṭir/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun//Mu&scaron;allim; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-uballiṭ/Bēl-ēṭir-nap&scaron;āti//Atkuppu; <strong>D</strong> = Nergal-u&scaron;ēzib"
