paraphrase: "Purchase of land. Receipt of purchase price<br /> <strong>A</strong> buys 0;1.5.5.8 sq. kor (c. 5325 m<sup>2</sup>) of land from <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> for 1 minas and 55 1/2 shekels of silver. It is a plot of land located in the open country (<em>ṣēru</em>), an orchard (<em>kir&ucirc;</em>) planted with date palms (<em>gi&scaron;immarē zaqpu</em>) bearing fruit (<em>iṣṣi bilti</em>) and ... (lacuna), within (<em>birīt</em>) the upper palmgrove (<em>gi&scaron;immaru elēnu</em>) in Hursagkalamma, in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Ki&scaron;. The field is described according to the neighbouring properties (among others, the house of the <em>&scaron;atammu</em>), then it is acknowledged that <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> has received (<em>mahāru </em>Stat.) 1 mina and 55 &frac12; shekels of silver as the total purchase price (<em>&scaron;īmu gamru</em>) for this land, plus 2 &frac12; shekels as additional payment (<em>atru</em>). In total, <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> receives 2 minas and 1 shekels of clipped silver (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>) from <strong>A</strong>. The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. Names of 4+ witnesses (introduced by the formula <em>ina kanakka ṭuppi &scaron;uati</em>). A broken passage at the end of the witness list and before the scribe&rsquo;s name, refers to <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong>, &ldquo;seller&rdquo; (<em>nādinatu</em>) of the field; then it is said that her daughter <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>C</strong>, also labelled&ldquo;seller&rdquo; (<em>nādinatu</em>) of the field, whose equalising payment (<em>takpurtu</em>) corresponds to 1 shekel of silver, <em>was present</em>(?) (<em>ina u&scaron;uzzi </em>or ina <em>a&scaron;abi</em>, reconstructed). This is followed by the name of the scribe: Bēl-ibni/Bēl&scaron;unu//Rē&#39;i-sīs&ecirc;. Finally, the text states that the fingernails (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller are impressed on the tablet instead of her seal impression (<em>kunukku</em>).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Kalbāya/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Inbāya/Nab&ucirc;?/Seppe; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Rē&rsquo;indu"
