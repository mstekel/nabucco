paraphrase: "Undertaking to deliver.<br /> In this document, someone whose name is not written explicitly (possibly <strong>A</strong>) commits to delivering sheep and a garment to <strong>C</strong>. The latter had received (<em>mahāru</em>) 6 kor of dates (c. 1080 l) from <strong>A </strong>who took as a security (<em>ubbuṭu</em>) for the (return of the) dates 12 sheep and 1 KUR.RA-garment&ndash; that had been entrusted <em>(paqdu</em>) to <strong>C</strong> -, and 2 more (<em>elat</em>) sheep, that belong to <strong>B</strong>. Thus, in total, <strong>A </strong>took 14 sheep and 1 KUR-RA-garment from <strong>C</strong>. Now, he (<strong>A</strong>?) will pay <strong>C</strong> in full (<em>eṭēru</em> D - <em>nadānu</em>) the sheep and the garment by the end of&nbsp; Ta&scaron;rīt (VII). Names of 2 witnesses (including <strong>B</strong>) and the scribe: Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir-nap&scaron;āti/Kiribtu//Bēl-aplu-uṣur.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-balāssu-iqbi/Erība-Marduk//Bēliau; <strong>B </strong>= Bēl-apla-iddin/Kabtia//Bābūtu; <strong>C</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n"
