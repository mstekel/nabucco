paraphrase: "Pledge of a house with antichresis. Security for a silver debt.<br /> <strong>A</strong> owes to <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> 1 mina of white medium quality silver, of which 1/8 is alloy. <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> takes his house, located near <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s house, as a pledge. She will pay no rent and there will be no interest on silver, until <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> will be paid. The house will be at her disposal for two years. Names of 5 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Nad&acirc;t-Ninlil/Iddināya//Ea-kabti-ilī; <strong>C</strong> = Ha&scaron;dāya/Nin-EZENxGU4-&scaron;arru-uṣur"
