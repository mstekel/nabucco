paraphrase: "Annulment of slave purchase.<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> (<strong>D</strong>&lsquo;s wife) sold the slave <strong>C</strong> together with his wife and six children to <strong>B, </strong>for 24 minas of medium quality silver, of which 1/8 is alloy. A sealed document about these slaves (<em>ameluttu</em>) had been issued at her request (<em>ana ṣib&ucirc;ti</em>) giving <strong>B</strong> title (<em>&scaron;umu</em>) to the slaves. The buyer, however, did not pay the sum of silver that had been agreed upon in the sale document (<em>&scaron;&aacute; ina &scaron;āṭari &scaron;aṭru</em>), and had therefore to return it (<em>t&acirc;ru</em> D &ndash; <em>nadānu</em>) to <strong><sup>f</sup>A. </strong>Should a copy turn up (in the future) it belongs to <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong>. Names of 8 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Amat-Bāba/Kalbāya//Nabāya, wife of <strong>D</strong>; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-Bēl&scaron;unu/Arad-Marduk//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Ea; <strong>C</strong> = Madān-bēlu-uṣur; <strong>D</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi"
