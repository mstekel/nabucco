paraphrase: "Sale of a slave.<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> (<strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s wife) had pledged her slave <strong>C </strong>to <strong>E</strong> (<em>bīt ma&scaron;kānu &scaron;a E</em>), and then <em>(re-)claimed</em> (<em>paqāru</em>) from him the pledged slave that she sold to him for a <em>hariṣ</em>-price amounting to 50 shekels of silver. Now she sells the slave of her own free will to <strong>B </strong>for the same <em>hariṣ</em>-price, 50 shekels of silver. <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> guarantees against (suits brought by) a person acting unlawfully (<em>sēh&ucirc;</em>) or a person claiming (<em>pāqirānu</em>) that <strong>C</strong> is a royal slave (<em>arad &scaron;arrūtu</em>) or a free person (<em>mār ban&ecirc;</em>). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A </strong>= <sup>f</sup>Ēṭirtu/Ahhē-iddin, wife of <strong>D</strong>; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;ma-attū&#39;a; <strong>D </strong>= Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu/Zēria; <strong>E</strong> = Ina-tē&scaron;&ecirc;-ēṭir (also written Tē&scaron;&ecirc;-ēṭir)"
