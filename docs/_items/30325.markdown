paraphrase: "Court protocol.<br /> <strong>A, B</strong>&rsquo;s slave, says thus to the judges of Nabonidus: &ldquo;<strong>B</strong> loaded a shipment of 480 kor (c. 86400 l) of <em>epirūtu-</em>dates from the hinterland onto <strong>C</strong>&lsquo;s boat (<strong>C</strong> being a boatman, <em>mallāhu</em>), who was responsible for the shipping. When the boat arrived to Babylon, <strong>C</strong> gave me <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s message (<em>&scaron;ipirtu</em>) that recorded the amount of 480 kor (c. 86400 l), but after a verification I have found that 47;1 kor (c. 8496 l) of dates were missing. I raised a claim against <strong>C</strong> concerning the shortfall (<em>mi</em><em>ṭ</em><em>ītu</em>), but he denied having taken the dates and has not refunded the loss. Therefore I have brought him before you: establish your decision!&rdquo;. The judges heard this deposition, read the pertinent written documents and interrogated <strong>C</strong>: they established that <strong>C </strong>must give 40 kor (c. 7200 l) of dates to <strong>A</strong>, corresponding to the shortfall of dates from the original load. Names of 5 judges and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nergal-rēṣūa; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Marduk; <strong>C</strong> = Amurru-natan/Ammāya"
