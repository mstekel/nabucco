paraphrase: "Pledge of slaves to secure a silver debt.<br /> <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>,<strong> <sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> (wife of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>) and <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> owe 1/3 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>. The payment is secured by the pledge of a female slave (<strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong>) and her son (<strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>).&nbsp; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong> should work for the creditor (<em>na&scaron;partu alāku</em>), while her son should work for his mother (<em>na&scaron;partu alāku</em>), probably meaning that he cannot be taken from her but should still assist her in her work. 8 shekels of the indebted silver is with one-fifth alloy (<em>hummu&scaron;u</em>) and 12 shekels is with one-eighth alloy (<em>bitqu</em>). &nbsp;Names of xxx witnesses and the scribe: Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Pir&rsquo;u//Arad-Nergal.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Kurbanni-Marduk/Bēl-nāṣir//Rab-ban&ecirc;; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Pir&#39;u/Marduk-u&scaron;allim//Ahu&rsquo;&ucirc;; <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>= <sup>f</sup>Gagāya, wife of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> = Zēria/L&acirc;bā&scaron;i//Ahu&rsquo;&ucirc;; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1 </sub></strong>= <sup>f</sup>Ahāt-abi&scaron;u, slave; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> =Barīk-il, slave, son of <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong>"
