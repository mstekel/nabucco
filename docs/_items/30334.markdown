paraphrase: "Transfer of the title to a creditclaim for silver to a new creditor and undertaking to inform the royal scribes.<br /> <strong>B </strong>owes &frac12; minas and 3 shekels (= 33 shekels) of silver to <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>, and 53⅓ shekels to <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> (- the ⅓ shekel is refined silver, <em>kaspu qal&ucirc;</em>). He granted his creditors title (<em>dagālu</em> &Scaron;) over (<em>pāni</em>) some of his real estate property, probably a house of [x] m<sup>2</sup>. For the debt of 53⅓ shekels to<strong> C<sub>2</sub></strong> he issued (<em>e&rsquo;ēlu</em>) a promissory note (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) in the name of <strong>D </strong>(<em>ana &scaron;ūmi</em>), who thus became the new creditor. The creditors (already) received (<em>etēru</em>) 25&frac34; shekels (wr. ⅓ m 5 &scaron; 3 <em>re-bat</em>) of silver, being <em>one-fourth</em>(?) (<em>rēbu</em>, wr. <em>ra-bu-&uacute;</em>) of the indebted silver. The present document is primarily concerned with the debt to <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> because the latter had in the meantime reached a deal with<strong> A</strong> in which he would turn over his creditclaim against <strong>B</strong> if <strong>A</strong> pays him the indebted silver (cf. BM30232 = EvM. 22). Accordingly, <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> receives (<em>mahāru</em>) 52⅓ shekels out of the 53&lt;⅓ &gt; shekels (that are due to him) from <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s proxy (<strong>E</strong>), and in return hands over to <strong>A</strong> the relevant promissory notes. <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> should inform (<em>qab&ucirc;</em>) the royal scribes (of the deal), seal the document and give it to <strong>A </strong>(<em>kanāku &ndash; nadānu)</em>. If he fails to do so, he should pay the silver (that is owed to him) and the interest on it to <strong>A</strong>. Names of 3 witnesses, a.o.
