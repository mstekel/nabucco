paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Antichretic pledge of land.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes a broken amount of silver to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>, a palace slave and to <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>. The payment is secured by 1 kor arable land (<em>z&ecirc;ru</em>) in Qalunu located next to(?) / in(?) a waterlogged area (<em>kal&ucirc;</em>). It is the debtor&#39;s (2/3<sup>rd</sup>) inheritance share (<em>pūt zitti</em>) in arable land that he owns together with <strong>C</strong>, his uncle (lit. &quot;a younger brother of his father&quot;).&nbsp; No other creditor shall exercise any rights over it until the creditors have received the full repayment. The creditors enjoy the right of usufruct in lieu of interest (antichresis). The silver had been given for a debt of <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s grandfather. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe: Marduk-nāṣir/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-ibni//Mu&scaron;&ecirc;zib<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;ab&scaron;i/Bēl-abu-uṣur, a palace slave; <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bēl-iddin/Pān-ilūssu; <strong>B</strong> = Nergal-zēru-ibni/Nergal-uballiṭ//Sagdidi; <strong>C</strong> = Taqī&scaron;-Gula (Nergal-uballiṭ//Sagdidi)"
