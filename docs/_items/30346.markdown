paraphrase: "Receipt for silver. Remainder of the purchase price for land.<br /> <strong>A </strong>receives (<em>mahāru</em>) 30 shekels of silver from <strong>B</strong>. This is what remained to be paid for the purchase of a plot of arable land (<em>zēru</em>) situated on a branch of the ancient Kutha-channel after it turned out that it was larger than originally thought so that the price that was agreed upon at the time of the sale (2 minas) needed to be recalculated. Names of 3 witnesses (including Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu/Marduk-bān-zēri//Bēl-ēṭir, the buyer&rsquo;s son-in-law) and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong><strong> = </strong>&Scaron;ama&scaron;-aplu-uṣur/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-ina-tē&scaron;&ecirc;-ēṭir//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;; <strong>B</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi"
