paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> The tablet records the purchase of agricultural land; the text has been divided into paragraphs, marked on the tablet by a line drawn at the end of each one (and indicated below in the paraphrase by LINE).<br /> <strong>A </strong>purchases 3 Kor (40500 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) located in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>) from <strong>B</strong>: it consists partly of cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) bearing fruit (<em>iṣṣi bilti</em>) and partly of grain cultivated as well as newly cleared land (<em>mēre&scaron;u u tapt&ucirc;</em>). It is located in Litamu, in front of the Ura&scaron; Gate, in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon. LINE<br /> Its upper side in the North borders on (the land of) <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>, and the lower side in the South on (the property of) <strong>D</strong>; its upper front in the West is adjacent to the royal street (<em>harrān &scaron;arri</em>) on the bank (<em>ki&scaron;ādu</em>) of the Piqūdu Canal and the lower front in the East borders on the dam of the&nbsp;<em>han&scaron;u</em>s (<em>makall&ucirc; &scaron;a han&scaron;ānē</em>) that is located at the lower end (<em>&scaron;ēpītu</em>) of a 5000-field complex LINE<br /> The 1 kor (13500 m<sup>2</sup>) of land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>) is valued (<em>&scaron;uqultu</em>) at a ratio of 16,75 shekels of silver per 0;0.1 kor (450 m<sup>2</sup>) of land, resulting in a total value of 8 minas and 22 1/2 shekels of silver.&nbsp; The 2 kor (27000 m<sup>2</sup>) of grain cultivated as well as newly cleared land is valued at a ratio of 1 shekel of silver per 0;0.0.3 Kor (225 m<sup>2</sup>) of land, resulting in a total value of 2 minas of silver. <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent for this land together with the seller <strong>B</strong> (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>) to be 10 minas and 22 1/2 shekels of silver. He pays the total purchase price (<em>&scaron;īmi&scaron;u gamrūtu</em>), plus 12 1/2 shekels of silver as additional payment (<em>k&icirc; atri</em>). LINE<br /> <strong>B</strong> acknowledges that he has received (<em>mahāru</em>) in total 10 minas and 35 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), and he is satisfied (<em>apālu </em>&nbsp;G Stat). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. The field will be measured: should it be found smaller or larger than what was originally calculated, they will compensate each other (<em>ahāmi&scaron; apālu </em>) according to the field-price ratio (<em>mahīru</em>) they agreed upon.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Ea-aplu-iddin/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk//Ṭābih-kāri; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Balāṭu; <strong>D</strong> = Gūzānu/Bā&#39;iru"
