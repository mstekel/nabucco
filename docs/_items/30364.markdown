paraphrase: "Restitution of escrow after the buyer&#39;s death.<br /> The document concerns 11 minas and 18 shekels of silver kept in a sealed leather bag (<em>himtu kaniktu</em>), the balance (<em>rīhtu</em>) of the purchase price of <strong>C</strong>&#39;s house which <strong>A</strong> bought. The buyer entrusted this silver to <strong>B</strong>, as an escrow (?) (<em>tek&ucirc;tu</em>) should a complaint from a creditor (<em>rā&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) arise about the sold house. Before <strong>A</strong>&#39;s death, there was no creditor to claim (the content of) the money bag.[...] 4 years after the deaths of <strong>A</strong>, the buyer, and <strong>B</strong>, the person who was in charge of the leather bag with the silver, <strong>C</strong> approached A&#39;s heir (<strong>D</strong>), but <strong>D</strong> did not agree to hand it over to him without the consent of the men in charge (<em>rāb&ucirc;</em>, lit. &ldquo;big ones&quot;) and the judges (<em>dayyānu</em>). [...] They appeared before men in charge and the judges and they asked <strong>E</strong>, the bishop (<em>&scaron;atammu</em>) of Esagila: &quot;Is there a claim of the temple against the silver kept in this bag?&quot; <strong>E</strong> answered: &quot;I do not know whether the temple or anyone else has a claim on it&ldquo;. Therefore, <strong>D</strong> has given the sealed leather bag to <strong>C</strong>, in the presence of <strong>F<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>F<sub>2</sub></strong>, two personal attendans <em>(kiz&ucirc;</em>), as well as <strong>F<sub>3</sub></strong> and <strong>F<sub>4</sub></strong>, the two judges.<br /> Cf. BM32863 (= Nbn 1047) and BM30890 (= Nbn 1048).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-ahhē-iddin/Marduk-zēru-ibni//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-rēmanni/ Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl/Ile&rsquo;&rsquo;i-Marduk; <strong>D</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi, <strong>B</strong>&#39;s son; <strong>E</strong> = Zēria, <em>&scaron;atammu</em> of Esagila; <strong>F<sub>1</sub></strong> = Kiribtu, <em>kiz&ucirc;</em>; <strong>F<sub>2</sub></strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl, <em>kiz&ucirc;</em>; <strong>F<sub>3</sub></strong> = Nergal-ahu-uṣur, <em>dayyānu</em>; <strong>F<sub>4</sub></strong> = &Scaron;umu-ukīn, <em>dayyānu</em>"
