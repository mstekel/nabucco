paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Subrogation.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 52 &frac12; shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>. He sold his house to the palace (<em>ana kaspi nadānu</em>) for exactly this sum. In the present document the creditor receives 1/3 (minas) 6 &frac14; shekels of silver out of it from <em>C</em> in accordance with what is stipulated in the credit balances (<em>ra&scaron;ūtu</em>), and transfers (<em>nadānu</em>) the title to the <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;debt (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) of 52 &frac12; shekels of silver to him. Thus, <strong>C </strong>has become the new creditor. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iqī&scaron;a/Gilūa//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-aplu-iddin/Balāṭu//&Scaron;a-&scaron;unā&scaron;i&scaron;u; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi"
