paraphrase: "About shares in the onion harvest.<br /> It concerns the 162000 onion strings that <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong> received (<em>mahāru) </em>from <strong>B</strong>, a courtier (<em>rē&scaron; &scaron;arri</em>), against the payment of 3 minas of silver. <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>&#39;s share in it, together with <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong> &hellip;. [broken off]. At the end of the document it is said that <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> will give to <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> from his share (<em>ina zitti&scaron;u</em>) something the details of which escape us because most of the passage is broken off. Names of at least 2 witnesses and the scribe: <em>Nab&ucirc;</em>-ēṭir-nap&scaron;āti/Kiribtu//Bēl-apla-uṣur<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Bēl-uballiṭ (without affiliation); <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = Iddin-Marduk(/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n); <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong> = Silīm-Bēl (without affiliation); <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;arrūssu-ukīn (<em>rē&scaron; &scaron;arri</em>)"
