paraphrase: "By the 20th of Simān (IV), <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> will pay 1 mina and 5 shekels of silver to <strong>B</strong>: this corresponds to the purchase price for the slave that <strong>B</strong> (being the creditor) took away (<em>abāku</em>) from them. Should they fail to pay their debt, they will compensate <strong>B</strong> for the slaves&rsquo; absence (<em>mandattu nadānu</em>) from the 1st of Nisan (I) onward. They guarantee for each other. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-zēru-u&scaron;ab&scaron;i/Bēl-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun; <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-neb-&scaron;arri/Bēl-iqī&scaron;a;<strong> B</strong> = &Scaron;ulāya/Nab&ucirc;-zēru-ukīn//Egibi<br /> <br /> &nbsp;"
