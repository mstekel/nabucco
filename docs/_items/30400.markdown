paraphrase: "Delivery of barley<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> receive from <strong>B </strong>for the 11<sup>th</sup> year the full amount of 25 kor barley (i.e. without deductions being made, <em>gamru</em>). The delivery takes place at the river (<em>nāru</em>) in Babylon and in accordance with the receipt (<em>giṭṭu</em>) and the tablet of <strong>C </strong>which were issued (<em>&scaron;aṭāru</em>) in <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s name. (It is) the barley of <strong>E<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>E<sub>2</sub></strong>, delivered in Duz&ucirc; (IV). Note that the present document is dated exactly in Duz&ucirc; (IV), i.e. immediately after the barley harvest. The names of 8 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Bēl-irha&scaron;&scaron;unu (without affliation); <strong>A<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Bēl-&scaron;umu-uṣur (without affliation); <strong>B </strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>C </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-uṣur (without affliation); <strong>D </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-tattannu-uṣur (without affliation); <strong>E<sub>1 </sub></strong>= &Scaron;arid (without affliation); <strong>E<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Bēl-ittannu (without affliation)"
