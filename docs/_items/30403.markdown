paraphrase: "Promissory note of silver and barley.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 8 minas and 10 shekels of silver and 3 kor (c. 540 l) of barley to <strong>A</strong>: this is what remains (<em>rīhtu</em>) to be paid for the purchase of a plot of land (<em>zēru</em>). The debtor will deliver (<em>nadānu</em>) them in two instalments: 5 minas of silver are due in Nisan (I), while the remaining silver together with the barley are due in Simān (III). Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Ea-aplu-iddin/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk//Ṭābih-kāri; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi"
