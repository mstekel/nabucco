paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases 0;0.2 Kor (900 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) from three members of the same family: <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, his nephew, and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>3</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>&rsquo;s mother. The land is located in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>): it is a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) in Litamu, in front of the Ura&scaron; Gate in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon &ndash; from the bank (<em>ki&scaron;ādu</em>) of the Piqudu-canal until it reaches the full extent (<em>&scaron;alāmu</em>) of 0;0.2 Kor (900 m<sup>2</sup>). Its upper side borders on (the land of) the daughters of <strong>C</strong>, its lower side on (the land of) <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong>; its upper front borders on the street that runs along the Piqudu-canal and its lower front stretches until it reaches the full extent of the field (<em>adi muhhi zēri i&scaron;allimu</em>).<br /> <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent of the field (<em>mahīra nab&ucirc;</em>) to be 14 shekels of silver per 0;0.1 kor (450 m<sup>2</sup>) and he adds 1/2 shekel of silver as additional payment (<em>k&icirc; p&icirc; atar</em>). In total, gives 28 1/2 shekels of white silver in pieces (<em>kaspa peṣ&ucirc; &scaron;ibirtu</em>) to <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>3</sub></strong>: the three sellers acknowledge that they have received (<em>eṭēru</em>) the total amount and that they are satisfied (<em>apilū</em>). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. Names of 10 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-zēru-ibni/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk//Abu-ul-īde; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Marduk-&scaron;umu-iddin/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-lī&scaron;ir//Abu-ul-īde; <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>3</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Kuttāya/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-bulliṭ//Abu-ul-īde; <strong>C</strong> = NI.DI-Marduk; <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Bu&rsquo;ītu/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk//Abu-ul-īde"
