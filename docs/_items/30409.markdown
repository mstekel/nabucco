paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> The top part of the tablet is broken, thus most of the details on the type, location and topographical features of the land are lost. From what is extant, one infers that the purchased land was divided into smaller measured areas. One of the sides of the first measured area borders on (the property of) <strong>A</strong>, the buyer, and another one on the second area listed in the text. More data are available for the second measured area (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>), which is the <em>a&scaron;kuttu </em>within the field (<em>libbi eqli</em>): its lower side in the East borders again on (the property of) <strong>A</strong>; the upper front in the North is adjacent to the area previously described and to (the land which belongs to) <strong>C</strong>, its lower front in the East is near to the &hellip; ditch (<em>harru</em>). In total, x+4 1/3 GAR (x+32,5 m<sup>2</sup>) of land including 1 B&Aacute;N 2/3 (750 m<sup>2</sup>) of a kind of land whose details are unknown. [&hellip;]+ 2/3 cubits (x+0,3 m) [&hellip;] <strong>A</strong> has purchased this land from the two brothers <strong>B<sub>1</sub> </strong>and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>: he has given them the silver corresponding to the total price plus another sum as additional payment, but the exact amount which he paid is lost because of the damaged condition of the tablet.<br /> <strong>B<sub>1</sub> </strong>and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> acknowledge that they have received (<em>mahāru</em>) the amount of silver corresponding to the entire purchase price of their field, and they are satisfied (<em>apālu, </em>G Stat). The usual closing formula which safeguarded against future complaints appears here in a shorter version: members and descendants of the families are in fact not mentioned. The clause, then, synthetically establishes that the two parties have no legal claims (<em>rugumm&ucirc;</em>), they will not come back on this issue and they will not suit each other. Any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received.The names of the witnesses and of the scribe are lost.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Arad-Gula; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = [the name is broken off]; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-uṣur&scaron;u/&hellip;"
