paraphrase: "House rental.<br /> <strong>A</strong> rents a house located at the head of the bridge (<em>gi&scaron;ru</em>) to <strong>B</strong>, for a rental price amounting to 5/6 minas of silver per year. It is agreed that half of the silver should be paid at the beginning of the year, and the remainder in the middle. The renter should caulk (<em>&scaron;an&ucirc;</em>) the roof and repair the wall foundations (<em>asurr&ucirc;</em>); <strong>A</strong> will receive 4 shekels of silver less from the rental price, in exchange for the work on the roof. The house is at the renter&rsquo;s disposal from the 1<sup>st</sup> of Ayyār (II) onwards. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nāṣiru/Bunanu//Eppe&scaron;-ilī"
