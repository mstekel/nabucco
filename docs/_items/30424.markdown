paraphrase: "Sale of a slave.<br /> <strong>A</strong>, of his own free will, sells his slave <strong>C</strong>, who is leprous (<em>garbānu</em>) and has the names of his previous owners <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>2</sub></strong> written (<em>&scaron;aṭāru</em>) on his hand, to <strong>B</strong> for its hariṣ-price amounting to 53 shekels of medium quality silver, of which 1/8 is alloy. The seller acknowledges that he has received (<em>eṭēru</em>) the silver of the purchase price for his slave from <strong>B</strong>. Should a claimant arise with regard to <strong>C</strong>, then <strong>A</strong> will free <strong>C </strong>from claims (<em>murruqu</em>) and hand him over to <strong>B</strong>. Names of 6 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk/Marduk-&scaron;umu-uṣur//Rab-ban&ecirc;; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Arad-Madānu; <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Takiltu; <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>2</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Bēletu"
