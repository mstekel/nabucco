paraphrase: "Dated short notice.<br /> A short note of 395000 strings (<em>gidlu</em>) of garlic. The text is fully dated. Considering the fact that it is written in Sīman (III), after the garlic harvest. This short note functions as a stock-taking. No place, witnesses or a scribe are mentioned.&nbsp;"
