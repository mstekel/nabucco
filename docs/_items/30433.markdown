paraphrase: "Pledge of a house with antichresis. Security for a silver debt.<br /> <strong>A </strong>owes to <strong>B </strong>an amount of silver which is unknown because the beginning of the tablet is broken. <strong>B</strong> takes as a pledge <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s house, located near <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s house. He will pay no rent and there will be no interest on silver (=antichresis). Names of 3 witnesses (including <strong>C</strong>) and the scribe: Marduk-&scaron;āpik-zēri/&hellip;-iddin(or: &scaron;umi)//Nādin-&scaron;e&rsquo;im<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Lūṣi-ana-nūri/Nergal-uballiṭ//Eppe&scaron;-ilī; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahu-iddin."
