paraphrase: "Sale of a slave.<br /> <strong>A</strong>, of his own free will, sells his slave <strong>C </strong>to<strong> B</strong>, at a <em>harīṣ-</em>price amounting to 51 shekels of silver. The seller guarantees against (suits brought by) a person acting unlawfully (<em>sēh&ucirc;</em>) or a person claiming (<em>pāqirānu</em>) that <strong>C </strong>is a free person (<em>mār ban&ecirc;</em>). The silver for this purchase has been taken from the income (<em>ina irbi</em>) from [&hellip;] and given to <strong>D</strong>. (This silver) is to be kept apart (<em>elat</em>) from a previous claim (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir/Nergal-&scaron;uma-ibni; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>C</strong> = Ilu-ikṣur; <strong>D</strong> = Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu"
