paraphrase: "Receipt?<br /> Fragmentary document about (the receipt of) dates, as much as &hellip;. (badly preserved passage). Apparently, they were due since 9<sup>th</sup> of Du&#39;&ucirc;zu (IV), and now, two months later&nbsp; <strong>A </strong>(= the creditor?) <em>receives them from</em> B (= the debtor?), but the verb of receipt is lost in the lacuna at the end of the obverse. The list with the names of the witnesses is also badly preserved. The name of the scribe: Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin (= creditor). Related to the debt mentioned in BM30710 (= Nbn 346).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi;<strong> B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-uṣur/&Scaron;āpik-zēri//&hellip;"
