paraphrase: "Undated list of tracts of land, measured by the 1000. Very fragmentary. Lines 16-17 mentions &quot;star-shaped land (<em>kakkabtu</em>), field (<em>eqlu</em>) of Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya&quot; who is perhaps to be identified with his namesake from the Egibi family. Each line starts with &quot;1000 (tracts of land) of&quot;, followed by specifications of the land quality, borders, etc., a.o.:<br /> (land) opposite (<em>tarṣu</em>) the estate of &Scaron;amā&#39;-ilu; (land) drained by ditches (<em>kaslu</em>); woodland (<em>qī&scaron;tu</em>); estate of Nab&ucirc; (<em>bīt Nab&ucirc;</em>); orchards (<em>kir&ucirc;</em>); the estate of &Scaron;arru-rēmanni; the wall (<em>dūru</em> ) of <em>Gidāya</em>."
