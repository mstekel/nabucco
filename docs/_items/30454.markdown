paraphrase: "Summons to establish a case.<br /> In Simān (III) (the exact day is lost in a lacuna), <strong>A</strong> (<strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s slave) will produce (<em>abāku</em>) his witness, who is called to establish the case (<em>k&acirc;nu &Scaron;</em>) against <strong>C</strong>, another of <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s slave. The witness will have to prove that <strong>A </strong>gave an iron <em>raqundu </em>(mng. unkn.) to<strong> C</strong>. Should he prove it, then <strong>C </strong>will give the <em>raqundu</em> back to <strong>A</strong>. Name of 1 witness and the scribe: <strong>D</strong>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = &Scaron;ar-Ea (? wr. <sup>d</sup>&uacute;-a), slave of <strong>B</strong>; <strong>B</strong> = Neriglissar; <strong>C</strong> = Hatānu, slave of <strong>B</strong>; <strong>D</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi"
