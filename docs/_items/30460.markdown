Undertaking under oath to pay in time.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes a broken amount (x minas) of silver to <strong>A</strong>, to be paid in Arahsamna (VIII). It is the price for his purchase of 3 four-year-old oxen and (the right to) their female offspring ((<em>w</em>)<em>aldu, </em>wr.<em> maldātu</em><sup>!</sup> Pl., T: <em>&scaron;iddatu</em>) for 4 years. <strong>B</strong> swears before Bēl and the king that he will pay (<em>eṭēru</em>) before Arahsamna has passed (<em>etēqu</em>). All (<em>mala ba&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) the slaves (<em>amīlūtu</em>) of <strong>B</strong> and his house in &Scaron;ahrītu are pledged to <strong>A</strong>. No other creditor shall dispose of the pledged slaves till <strong>A</strong> has received his silver in full. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe: Arad-Bēl/Bēl-ēṭir//<em>Egibi</em>.
