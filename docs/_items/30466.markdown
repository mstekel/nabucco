paraphrase: "Undertaking under oath to bring the new co-debtor after a debt renewal.<br /> <strong>A</strong> swears to <strong>B</strong>, by the gods and the king, that by<em> mid</em> (<em>qablu</em>)(*) &Scaron;abāṭ (XI) he will bring along (<em>abāku</em>) <strong>C, </strong>&nbsp;re-issue (<em>e&rsquo;ēlu</em>) the promissory notes for silver, wool and sheep that he together with <strong>C</strong> owe to <strong>B</strong>, and hand them over (<em>nadānu</em>) to <strong>B</strong>. It concerns debts that were originally owed by <strong>A</strong> together with <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s father (<strong>D</strong>) to <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s father-in-law (<strong>E</strong>). <strong>A</strong> had taken the promissory notes about these debts away (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) from (<em>lapāni</em>) <strong>B</strong>, no doubt to have them re-issued in his own name and in the name of his new co-debtor <strong>C.</strong> See also BM31531. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe: Taqī&scaron;-Gula/<em>Arad-Marduk</em>//<em>Bēl</em>-ēṭir.<br /> Notes: (*) Sandowicz 2012 reads <em>i-na</em> instead of <em>qablu</em>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = &Scaron;addinnu/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun//Mandidi; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi, <strong>E</strong>&rsquo;s son-in-law; <strong>C</strong> = &Scaron;irik/Marduk-erība//S&icirc;n-karābī-i&scaron;me, son of <strong>D</strong>; <strong>D</strong> = Marduk-erība/Iqī&scaron;a//S&icirc;n-karābī-i&scaron;me, father of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>E</strong> = IddinMarduk/Iqī&scaron;a//Nūr-S&icirc;n; Undertaking under oath to bring along the co-debtor&rsquo;s son and renew the promissory note.<br /> <strong>A </strong>takes an oath by the gods and the king about a promissory note (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) for silver, wool and sheep which he and <strong>B</strong> owe to <strong>C</strong>, and which he received (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) from (<em>lapāni</em>) <strong>D</strong>, the son of <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s daughter. <strong>A</strong> swears that that by the middle (<em>qabl&ucirc;</em>) of &Scaron;abāṭ (XI) he will present <strong>E</strong>, the son of his co-debtor, &nbsp;together with <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s promissory note. He and <strong>E</strong> will have to bind themselves anew (<em>e&rsquo;ēlu</em>) (to that agreement), and they will give the document to <strong>D</strong>. The consequences of a possible failure in sticking to this commitment are not fully written out in this tablet. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe: Arad-Gula/<em>Marduk-&scaron;umu-uṣur</em>//Ēṭiru<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= &Scaron;addinnu/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun//Mandidi; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-erība/Iqī&scaron;āya//S&icirc;n-karābī-i&scaron;me; <strong>C</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>D</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi, nephew of <strong>C</strong>;<strong> E</strong> = &Scaron;irik/Marduk-erība//S&icirc;n-karābī-i&scaron;me (son of <strong>B</strong>)"
