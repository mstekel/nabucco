paraphrase: "Rescission of previous purchase of land, with receipt for redemption of silver.<br /> <strong>A</strong> had bought (<em>mahīra epē&scaron;u</em>) two plots of land from <strong>B</strong>, paying their full price (<em>ana kasap gamirtu</em>), in Darius 18<sup>th</sup> year. The purchase included land cultivated with trees and grain (<em>zēru zaqpu u mēre&scaron;u</em>) located in Litamu in front of the Ura&scaron; Gate in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon, and another house building plot (<em>qan&ucirc;</em>) in Hursagkalamma, near to <strong>C</strong> &lsquo;s house . The silver (the exact amount is lost because the top part of the tablet is broken) and its interest (<em>hubullu</em>) have been paid (<em>eṭēru</em> N) by <strong>A</strong> to <strong>B</strong>, as written in the document recording the deal (<em>ak&icirc; ṭuppi mahīri</em>).<br /> Now, one or more years later (the tablet is certainly dated after Darius&rsquo; 19<sup>th</sup> year, but the passage regarding the date is poorly preserved), <strong>A </strong>rescinds his previous purchase and gives (<em>nadānu</em>) the possessory title (<em>ṭuppi mahīri</em>) back to <strong>B</strong>. The parties agree that there is no claim or legal lawsuit (<em>dīnu u ragāmu</em>), nor any other creditor&rsquo;s claim (<em>mimma ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu gabbi</em>) from <strong>A</strong> against <strong>B</strong>, regarding the field and house building plot of land. Names of 7 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-muballissu/Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir-nap&scaron;āti//S&icirc;n-tabni-uṣur; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-&hellip;/Erība-Marduk//Arad-Nergal"
