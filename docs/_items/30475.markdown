paraphrase: "Purchase of land.<br /> The tablet records the purchase of agricultural land which, given its irregular shape, is calculated according to two measured areas: each one of these plots is described separately, marked on the tablet by a line drawn at the end of each paragraph (and indicated below in the paraphrase by LINE).<br /> <strong>A</strong> purchases 5;1.3.5 kor (71925 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) located in the open country from <strong>B</strong>. It consists partly of cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) bearing fruit (<em>iṣṣi bilti</em>) and partly of grain cultivated as well as wasteland (<em>mēre&scaron;u u </em><em>ki&scaron;ubb&ucirc;</em>). It is located below the Bānītu canal, in front of the Zababa Gate, in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon. LINE<br /> The first measured area (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>), consisting of 0;3.1.0.5 Kor (8587,5 m<sup>2</sup>) of cultivated date garden (<em>gi&scaron;immarē zaqpu</em>) and 0;0.1.4.8 Kor (810 m<sup>2</sup>) of wasteland, has a regular shape: its two long sides measure each 949 cubits (474,5 m) &ndash; the upper one in the West borders on (the property of) <strong>B</strong>, the seller, and the lower one in the East on (the property of) <strong>C</strong>. The two short sides measure each 40 cubits (20 m): the upper front in the North is adjacent to the royal street (<em>harrān &scaron;arri</em>) on the bank (<em>ki&scaron;ādu</em>) of the Bānītu Canal and its lower front in the South borders on the second measured area (<em>libbu eqli</em>). LINE<br /> The second portion (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>) consists of 3;0.1.4.7 Kor (41302,5 m<sup>2</sup>) of cultivated date garden (<em>gi&scaron;immarē zaqpu</em>) and 1;2.5.1 Kor (21225 m<sup>2</sup>) of land cultivated with grain (<em>mēre&scaron;u</em>). Its upper side in the West measures 1630 cubits (815 m) and borders on (the property of) <strong>B</strong>, the seller; the lower side in the East is 1614 cubits (807 m) long and borders on (the property of <strong>D</strong>). The two short sides measure each 160 cubits (80 m): the one in the North is adjacent to the first measured area and (the property of) <strong>C</strong> &ndash; while the one in the South borders on (the property of) <strong>B</strong>, the seller. LINE<br /> Overall, the purchased land measures 5;1.3.5 Kor (71925 m<sup>2</sup>). It includes (<em>ina libbi</em>) 3;3.2.5.2 Kor (c. 49890 m<sup>2</sup>) of date garden (<em>gi&scaron;immarē zaqpu</em>) valued (<em>&scaron;uqultu</em>) at a ratio of 1 shekel of silver per 0;0.0.0.6 Kor (45 m<sup>2</sup>) resulting in a total value of 18 minas and 28 2/3 shekels &ndash; and 1;3.0.5.8 Kor (22035 m<sup>2</sup>) of cultivated as well as wasteland (<em>mēre&scaron;u u </em><em>ki&scaron;ubb&ucirc;</em>) valued (<em>&scaron;uqultu</em>) at a ratio of 1 shekel of silver for each 0;0.1 Kor (450 m<sup>2</sup>) of land resulting in a total value of 49 shekels. <strong>A</strong> declares the equivalent for this land together with the seller <strong>B</strong> (A <em>itti</em> B <em>mahīra nab&ucirc; i&scaron;ām</em>) to be 19 minas and 17 2/3 shekels of silver: he pays (<em>nadānu</em>) the total purchase price (<em>&scaron;īmi&scaron;u gamrūtu</em>), plus 1 mina and 20 shekels of silver as additional payment (<em>k&icirc; atri</em>). LINE<br /> <strong>B</strong> acknowledges that he has received (<em>mahāru</em>) in total 20 minas and 37 2/3 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), and he is satisfied (<em>apālu</em> G Stat). The parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received. Fingernail impressions (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller <strong>B</strong>, instead of his seal impression (<em>kunukku</em>).
