paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver, within the framework of a business partnership (<em>harrānu</em>).<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 20 shekels of medium quality silver, of which one-fifth is alloy, in addition to (<em>elat</em>) 5 kor of barley to <strong>A</strong>. The (indebted) silver is what <strong>C</strong> invested in a business partnership (with <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>) and is to be used for the purchase (<em>&scaron;īmu</em>) of seeds (<em>zēru</em>). They agreed (<em>magāru </em>Gt) that it should be entirely paid back (<em>&scaron;alāmu</em> G) from the debtor&rsquo;s income from an onion field (<em>&scaron;ikittu</em>) which he is cultivating (<em>erē&scaron;u</em>). The barley should be delivered in D&ucirc;zu (IV). The earlier promissory note is invalid (<em>hep&ucirc;</em>). Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Sūqāya/Marduk-ēṭir/Ṭābih-kāri.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= &Scaron;iriktu/Nūrea//Dannea; <strong>B </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-damiq/Nab&ucirc;-bān-zēri; <strong>C </strong>= Iddin-Marduk"
