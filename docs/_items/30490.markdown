paraphrase: "Promissory note for dates, barley and silver. Payment for a debt.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 88.1;3.0.0 kor of dates, 11.2.4.4 kor of barley (and) 4 &frac12; shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>. The silver should be paid in Nisan (I). The full amount of barley should be delivered in one instalment according to the creditor&rsquo;s measure in Ayyār (II) at the Borsippa-canal. The full amount of dates should be delivered in one [instalment] according to the creditor&rsquo;s [measure] in Ta&scaron;rīt (VII) at the [name of the canal is broken off]. The text continues by referring to [land (?)] in Uruk [&hellip;], that the creditor took as pledge. No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged objects until <strong>A</strong> has received the full repayment of his debt. A fragmentarily preserved passage refers to going on a campaign on behalf of the king (<em>alaktu &scaron;a &scaron;arri</em>)(*) and travel provisions (<em>ṣidittu</em>) [&hellip;] that have been paid for to the summoner official (<em>dēk&ucirc;</em>). The document concludes by pointing out that the (indebted) silver has been paid for the obligations to provide military equipment (<em>rikis qabli</em>) and serve as (or furnish) a replacement (<em>kutall&ucirc;tu</em>) for Cambyses&rsquo; 5<sup>th</sup> year.
