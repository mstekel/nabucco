paraphrase: "Promissory note for barley and silver.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 50 kor of barley, 1(*) mina of medium quality silver, of which one-eighth is alloy and 1 mina of stamped (?) silver (<em>ginnu</em>) to <strong>A</strong>. In D&ucirc;zu (IV), the barley should be delivered according to the 36 liters measure. The mentioned silver, namely, 2 minas, of which 1 mina 40(?) and [&hellip;] (= something the details of which are lost in the broken passage), should be paid in &Scaron;ahrīnu. It is not said when the silver payment should take place, unless this was specified in the broken passage. In addition, there is an earlier claim by the same creditor which is still pending.
