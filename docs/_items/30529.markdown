paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Interest at default. Fragmentary.<br /> The beginning of the tablet is broken off. Then we hear that <strong>B</strong> owes 1/2 minas and 8 shekels of silver .... [broken off], a remainder, to <strong>A</strong>. He should pay it without interest according to a previous <em>tablet</em>(?) (GI&Scaron; &Uacute; NU, uncl.) in D&ucirc;zu (IV). He will start paying the yearly 20% interest on a monthly basis, if he fails to meet the deadline. Witnesses.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = &hellip;/&hellip;//Arabti; <strong>B</strong> =&nbsp; Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi (&Scaron;irku/Iddināya); <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-nādin-apli"
