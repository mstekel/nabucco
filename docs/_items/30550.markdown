paraphrase: "Promissory note for barley.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 10;1.4 kor of barley to <strong>A</strong>. The creditor is probably to be identified with the head of the Egibi family (Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu, aka &Scaron;irku). Names of 2 (or 3?) witnesses, but not introduced by <em>mukinnu </em>(&quot;witness&quot;), and the scribe: Nidintu/&hellip; .<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = &Scaron;irik (without affiliation, or broken?); <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-uṣur (without affiliation, or broken?)"
