paraphrase: "Promissory note for dates. General pledge.<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> owe 16;3.2.0 kor of dates to <strong>A</strong>, to be delivered in Arahsamna (VIII), on the creditor&#39;s plot of land (<em>bītu</em>). They assume warranty for each other and the one who has dates available at the due date shall deliver them to the creditor.<strong> D</strong> acts as guarantor for the delivery. Originally, the debt was debited against<strong> <sup>f</sup>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and husband (<strong>C</strong>) with <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> as guarantor. In addition, there is a promissory note for a young male goat and a young sheep, which was due two and a half years ago (lit. &quot;since Ṭebēt (X) of the 9<sup>th</sup> year&quot;). All their property in and outside the city are pledged to the creditor (for both debts?). No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged property. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Niqudu/Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-apli//Sipp&ecirc;(a).<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n;<strong> <sup>f</sup>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ka&scaron;&scaron;āya/Nab&ucirc;-bān-ahi; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Madān-ahu-iddin/Bēl-ahu-u&scaron;ab&scaron;i//Malahu; <strong>C</strong> = Iqūpu, husband of <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>D</strong> = Gūzānu/Rēmūtu//Arad-Nergal."
