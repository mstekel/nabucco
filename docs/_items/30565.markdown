paraphrase: "Receipt of silver from the head of the Egibi family.<br /> Two brothers, <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>, receive (<em>mahāru</em>) silver from <strong>B</strong> in accordance with what is stipulated (<em>ina</em>) in their promissory notes (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>). The amount is broken but may be reconstructed as 1 &frac12; minas on the basis of MNB1870 (= TCL 13 185). It includes (<em>adi</em>) half the mina that <strong>B</strong> had transferred (<em>nadānu</em>, G Stat.) to <strong>C</strong> (for which see BM77848 = Dar 213). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>=Bēl-nādin-apli/Bēl-uballiṭ//Pahāru;&nbsp;<strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>=Nab&ucirc;-iddin/Bēl-uballiṭ//Pahāru;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=Marduk-naṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi;&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>=&Scaron;umu-ukīn/Bēl-ēṭir//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Nanāya"
