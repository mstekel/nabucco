paraphrase: "Letter concerning an <em>ilku</em>-payment<strong>.</strong><br /> The sender of this letter informs <strong>B</strong> that <strong>C</strong>, a Babylonian who resides (<em>a&scaron;ābu</em>) in <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s house in Bīt-Hahhuru, paid (<em>it-ta-din </em>[<em>nadānu</em>]) for his <em>ilku</em>-tax and <strong>B</strong> should not argue with him about it (<em>itti PN dabābu</em>). The name of the sender is not preserved. Jursa AOAT 414/1, 168 argues that he was most likely a <em>rab han&scaron;&ecirc;</em>-official responsible for the mobilisation of troops considering the fact that in the current letter he receives <em>ilku</em>-silver, i.e. silver that was earmarked for paying the soldiers who will actually perform <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s military service. The addressee is to be identified with Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu, head of the Egibi family. <strong>C</strong> is probably identical with his namesake from the Ibni-ilu family, for whom see Wunsch2000032.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=&hellip;;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=&Scaron;irik (wr. <sup>m</sup><em>&scaron;i-rik-ki</em>) (=?Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi);&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>=Bēl-iddin (= Bēl-iddin/S&icirc;n-ēre&scaron;//Ibni-ilu);&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>=Bēl-zēru-iddin"
