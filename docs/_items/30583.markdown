paraphrase: "Labour contract to sail a boat to Babylon as part of the <em>kan&scaron;u</em>-service. Salary to be paid by the head of the Egibi family.<br /> <strong>A</strong> shall sail for a monthly salary of 8 shekels in the boat that belongs to <strong>B</strong> (<em>ina eleppi alāku</em>). It is part of (<strong>B</strong>&#39;s<sup>?</sup>) <em>kan&scaron;u</em> service for the King. <strong>B</strong> shall give 0.1.1.3 kor royal flour<sup>!?</sup>(<em>qēmu</em>)*, cress (<em>sahl&ucirc;</em>) and oil (<em>&scaron;amnu</em>) to <strong>A</strong> each month. The document describes in detail what <strong>A</strong> can and cannot do with the boat, but the passage is fragmentary. Apparently, he may (or: shall) sail to Babylon and Babylonians are said to be on the boat. Another fragmentary clause stipulates that &quot;from the 10<sup>th</sup> of Simān (III) [PN] [...] shall g[ive].&quot; Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> *Wr.
