paraphrase: "About a ploughed field from a bow-fief, and about a plow (team) that belongs to the head of the Egibi family. Very fragmentary.<br /> Concerns arable land (<em>zēru</em>) that has been broken up by the <em>mayāru</em>-plow, belongs to <strong>A</strong>&#39;s bow-land (<em>bīt qa&scaron;ti</em>) and has been given to <strong>B</strong>. What exactly happens with it is lost in the badly preserved passages of the tablet. The plow team (<em>epinnu</em>) of <strong>C</strong> is mentioned but in a broken context. Names of 5 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=Nergal-nāṣir;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=Iddinaya/Arad-Bēl;&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Iddinaya//Egibi (=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi)"
