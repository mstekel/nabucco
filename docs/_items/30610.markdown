paraphrase: "Receipt for silver and return of pledged slaves.<br /> Concerns the debt of 3(!) minas of medium-quality silver, of which 1/8 is alloy,&nbsp;that&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>&nbsp;owes to&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>&nbsp;and for which two of the debtor&#39;s&nbsp;slaves (<strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong>) were taken as pledge.<br /> The promissory note that was issued provided that&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>&nbsp;should pay back his debt&nbsp;by the 20th&nbsp;of Nisan (I)&nbsp;(the duplicate has Nisan, 10th),&nbsp;i.e. within half a year:&nbsp;should he fail&nbsp;to do so, his pledged slaves would have been&nbsp;transferred to the creditor&rsquo;s ownership&nbsp;with the purchase price being equal to&nbsp;the value of the debt. In the present document, dated in Abu (V), it is recorded that&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>&nbsp;gives&nbsp;the 3 minas of silver to&nbsp;<strong>A&nbsp;</strong>(thus&nbsp;paying his debt within the established deadline). As a result,&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>&nbsp;promptly returns&nbsp;the promissory note together with the&nbsp;slaves to&nbsp;<strong>B&nbsp;</strong>(<em>t&acirc;ru-nadānu</em>). Names of 8 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A&nbsp;</strong>= Bēl-ibni/&Scaron;āpik-zēri//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-S&icirc;n;&nbsp;<strong>B&nbsp;</strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi;&nbsp;<strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>= Nab&ucirc;-lū-&scaron;ulmu,&nbsp;slave of&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>;&nbsp;<strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong>=&nbsp;<sup>f</sup>Lū-balṭat"
