paraphrase: "Promissory note for dates and silver. Payment for rikis qabli.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 100 kor of dates (and) 1/3 mina of silver to <strong>A</strong>. The dates should be delivered in Ta&scaron;rīt (VII). In Addar (XII) of Cambyses&rsquo; 1<sup>st</sup> year, the silver should be paid at the rate of 100 bundles per shekel(*). He should pay the dates and silver from the income of his earlier pledged plot of land. In addition, there is an earlier claim by <strong>A</strong> that is still outstanding. The 1/3 mina is the equivalent in silver (<em>&scaron;īmu</em>) for the dates and onions that were delivered in payment for the <em>rikis qabli</em> of the 1<sup>st</sup> year. Witnesses.<br /> (*)1 &scaron;iqlu 100 <em>pi-tu</em><sub>4 </sub>(?)<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= Nergal-nāṣir/Nādin"
