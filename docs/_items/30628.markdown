paraphrase: "Promissory note for assessed field rent (<em>imittu</em>), to be delivered in barley. Fragmentary.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 26.0.0.0 kor of barley to <strong>A</strong>, slave of <strong>C</strong>. It is the assessed field rent (<em>imitti eqli</em>) on <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s field, located at the upper gate (<em>bābu elēnu</em>) next to (the field of (?)) the Bēl and Nab&ucirc;-temples and pledged to <strong>A</strong>. Details on the terms of repayment are mainly lost in the broken passage at the end of the tablet&rsquo;s obverse side and beginning of its reverse side. When the text becomes legible again, it is said that the payment for the tithe of the Nergal-temple (<em>e&scaron;r&ucirc; &scaron;a Nergal</em>) has been settled (<em>eṭēru </em>G Stat). In addition, there is an earlier claim (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) but the pertinent passage is badly preserved: [&hellip;] half a share (<em>ahi zitti</em>) [&hellip;] <strong>D</strong> they will &hellip; (<em>&uacute;-&scaron;u-uz-zu</em>)(?). Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Bēl-iddin/Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-zēri//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Nergal-rēṣūa, slave of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>B </strong>= [the name of the debtor is broken off]; <strong>C </strong>= Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>D </strong>= Nergal-nāṣir/Nādin"
