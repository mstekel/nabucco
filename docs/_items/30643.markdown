paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Fixation of interest at default. Pledge of a house.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 2 minas and 5 &frac12; shekels of medium quality silver, of which one-eighth is alloy to <strong>A</strong>, to be delivered without interest (<em>qaqqadu</em>) in Ayyār (II). The debtor will start paying the usual 20% of interest on a monthly basis if he fails to meet the deadline. In addition, there is an earlier promissory note for 7 1/3 minas of white silver which is secured by the pledge of the debtor&rsquo;s house (<em>ma&scaron;kānu ṣabātu</em>). Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Bēl-erība/Iddin-Nab&ucirc;//Ea-eppe&scaron;-ilī; <strong>B </strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi."
