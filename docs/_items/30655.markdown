paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver<br /> <strong>B</strong>, slave of <strong>F</strong>, owes 12 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>, slave of <strong>C</strong>, to be paid on the 8th of Ta&scaron;rīt (VII). The silver is meant to compensate <strong>F</strong> for the loss of income due to the absence of his female slave (<strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong>) (<em>mandattu</em>). She had most likely been pledged by <strong>B </strong>(her husband) to secure one of his silver debt, and consequently she was unavailable to her master. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;-iddin//Egibi (brother of Itti-Marduk-balāṭu).<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nergal-rēṣūa, slave of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-utirri, slave of Itti-Marduk-balāṭu; <strong>C</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Miṣatu, slave of <strong>F</strong> (and wife of <strong>B</strong>); <strong>F</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu"
