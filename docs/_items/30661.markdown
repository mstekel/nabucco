The dates should be delivered to the courtyard (<em>haṣāru</em>) in one payment according to the 36 liters measure. Delivery is due in Arahsamna (VIII). They should also deliver the usual by-products of the date cultivation: for each kor of dates they shall give spathes (<em>tuhallu</em>), spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>), fibres (<em>mangagu</em>), a load of firewood, (and) 2 <em>darīku</em>-containers. The two debtors assume warranty for each other. In addition, there are two date-palmtrees with a 0;1.2.0 kor (of yield). They will receive (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) remuneration for their gardening work (<em>&scaron;issinnu</em>) according to the amount of work they do (<em>mala ina libbi</em> <em>epē&scaron;u</em>).
