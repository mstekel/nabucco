paraphrase: "Promissory note for barley, silver and onions.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 40;0.0.0 kor of barley, 1 mina of silver and&nbsp; 3330 strings (<em>gidlu</em>) of onion to <strong>A</strong>, the slave of <strong>C</strong>, to be delivered in two installments. The silver and onions are due in Nisan (I); the full amount of barley (<em>gamru</em>) according to the creditor&#39;s measure is due in Ayyār (II), and should be delivered on the creditor&#39;s plot of land (or: house) (<em>bītu</em>). Half of the silver should be paid in onions from the debtor&#39;s onion field (<em>&scaron;i-ti-ik-&scaron;&uacute; [&scaron;ikittu]</em>). This barley was given (to <strong>B</strong>) (<em>nadānu</em>, G Stat) to buy seeds and pay for the maintenance (of the farmers); and the silver was given to pay for outstanding obligations (<em>rēhu</em>). Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Bēl-ibni/Nergal-zēru-ibni//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Nanāya.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Madān-bēlu-uṣur, slave of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>B</strong> = Barīki-Adad//Iahalu (wr. <em>ia-ha-a-lu</em>); <strong>C</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n"
