paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Payment for harbor costs.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 50 shekels of medium quality silver, of which one-eighth is alloy, to <strong>A</strong>, the royal harbor master (<em>rab kāri &scaron;a &scaron;arri</em>), to be delivered (in onions) on the 20<sup>th</sup> of Nisan (I). The silver is for covering the royal harbor costs that are made in the course of an onion transport (<em>kaspu &scaron;a kāri &scaron;a &scaron;arri</em>). Additionally, the debtor should provide 3500 strings of good quality onions and this is somehow related to <strong>C</strong>&#39;s boat, but it is not immediately clear how (Wunsch 1993, 37). Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-lī&scaron;ir/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Nab&ucirc;//Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;eme.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Gimillu/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-zēru-ibni//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu, royal harbor master (<em>rab kāri &scaron;a &scaron;arri</em>); <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;allim/Īnia; <strong>C</strong> = Bunene-ibni"
