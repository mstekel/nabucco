paraphrase: "Letter concerning <em>rikis qabli</em> and the recruitement of troops. The head of the Egibi family is involved.<br /> The names of the sender and addressee are lost but can be reconstructed on the basis of a comparison with AO8930, BM30688 and BM 33077 (Jursa AOAT 414/1).<br /> <strong>A</strong> complains that he has not heard from <strong>B</strong>. The troops have not been released this year (<em>paṭāru</em> D). When <strong>C</strong> came to <strong>A</strong> to settle accounts (<em>nishu nasāhu</em>), he paid the <em>rikis qabli</em> (<em>nadānu</em>). The addressee is urged to pay (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em> N) his share (<em>zittu</em>) of the <em>rikis qabli-</em>obligation&nbsp;and assist <strong>C</strong> (<em>itti u&scaron;uzzu</em>) in recruiting (<em>esēru</em>) soldiers (<em>ṣābu</em>), so that he will not cause delay and let him return empty-handed (<em>etēqu</em> &Scaron;). If he fails to do so, <strong>A</strong> will inform the appointed supervisor (<em>bēl piqitti</em>), and <strong>B</strong> risks to be hand-cuffed (<em>izqātu</em>) and pressured to pay his <em>rikis qabli</em> (<em>rakāsu</em>). <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s threat is reinforced by an oath.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=Libluṭ;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=Dummuqu;&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>=&Scaron;i&scaron;ku (=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi)"
