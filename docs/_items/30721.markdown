Silver had been transferred to the debtor to pay for <em>rikis qabli</em>. Reference to an outstanding debt of dates, barley, onions and silver secured by pledge.<br /> <strong>B</strong> should pay 1/2 mina of silver and 30 bundles of onions that are due from him to <strong>A</strong> in Nisan (I) of the 6<sup>th</sup> year. <strong>A</strong> will receive full repayment (<em>&scaron;alāmu</em>) from his (=the debtor&#39;s) income from the <em>&scaron;ib&scaron;u</em>-impost on land (<em>ina &scaron;ib&scaron;i eqli&scaron;u</em>).
