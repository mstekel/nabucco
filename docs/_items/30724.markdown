paraphrase: "Promissory note to pay a debt of silver and dates to a slave of the Egibi family. Pledge of land. Silver had been transferred to the debtor to pay for <em>rikis qabli</em>.<br /> <strong>B</strong> should pay 30 kor of dates and 1/2 mina of marked silver that are due from him to <strong>A</strong>, a slave of <strong>C</strong>, in Ta&scaron;rit (VII) of the 12<sup>th</sup> year in &Scaron;ahrīnu. Payment is in one instalment according to the 36 liter measure. In the same month he should also pay 1/2 mina of marked silver without interest (<em>ina qaqqadi</em>). The debtor&#39;s plot of land planted with trees (<em>eqlu p&icirc; &scaron;ulpi</em>) and palm grove (<em>gi&scaron;immaru</em>) are pledged to the creditor until he has received full repayment (<em>&scaron;alāmu</em>) of his silver and his dates. The (indebted) silver is that which has been given (<em>nadānu</em>, G Stat.), probably to <strong>B</strong>, although the text does not explicitly say so, to pay for the <em>rikis qabli</em> (of the men who have) to go to Elam.* Names of 5 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> *<em>kaspa&#39; rikis qabli &scaron;a ana Elam</em> <em>nadnu</em>, a cryptic version of similar clauses found in e.g. BM41451 (=Dar167) and BM41428 (=Dar 164).<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=Madān-bēlu-uṣur, slave of <strong>C;&nbsp;</strong><strong>B</strong>=Bēl-iddin/Nab&ucirc;-zēru-u&scaron;ab&scaron;i;&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>=Marduk-nāṣir-apli//Egibi"
