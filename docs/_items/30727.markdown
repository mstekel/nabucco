paraphrase: "About a plot of land with a house built on it. Head of the Egibi family is among the neighbours.<br /> All that is preserved of this fragmentary tablet is the description of the land. It measures 24 reeds and is located in the neighbourhood called &Scaron;u&rsquo;anna within Babylon. <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> own neighbouring houses [...]. Their houses (or the land under discussion, uncl.) continues down (<em>murradu, </em>lit. &quot;descent, slope&quot;) into the Hubur street (<em>sūqu</em>) as far as (the house of) <strong>C</strong>. The remainder of the tablet may have recorded a sale. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=Bēl-erība/Nab&ucirc;-bēl&scaron;unu//Abu-ul-īde;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=Nab&ucirc;-bullissu/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun;&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>=&Scaron;i&scaron;ki/<em>Iddinaya</em>//<em>Egibi</em> (=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi)"
