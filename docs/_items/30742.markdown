paraphrase: "Receipt for silver.<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> receives 10 minas and 5 shekels of silver from <strong>B</strong>. This does not include the 1 mina of silver that were paid (by him) to <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>, (and) for (the payment of which) a house (had been taken)(*) as pledge. It apparently includes the silver (followed by a broken passage), that <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> received - we may assume that meant are all other amounts of silver that she received from the same person in the past. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe. At the end of the document, after the list of witnesses and the date, it is said that included are (also) (<em>adi</em>) the 2 shekels of silver that were paid to <strong>D</strong>. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe. (*) silver <em>&scaron;</em><em>a ana</em> <strong><sup>f</sup>A </strong><em>&scaron;a bīt ma&scaron;kā</em><em>ni [ṣab-t]a-ta nadnu. </em>The unpublished copy Bertin 746 reads &ldquo;one mina of silver which had been given to f<strong>C </strong>for the house [...] as pledge&rdquo;.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <sup>f</sup>A = <sup>f</sup>Ṭābatu/Bēl-ahhē-erība//&Scaron;a-ṭābtī&scaron;u; B = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <sup>f</sup>C = <sup>f</sup>Amat-Ninlil(/Zēru-Bābili ?); D = Ubār"
