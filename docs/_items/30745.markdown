paraphrase: "Receipt for silver by the borrower from the lender.<br /> Concerns the debt (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) for 10 minas of silver that <strong>A</strong> issued against <strong>B</strong>. The present document confirms that the latter received the full amount of silver from <strong>A</strong>. This does not include the 12 1/2 shekels of silver for the purchase of mustard-seeds (<em>kas&ucirc;</em>). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B </strong>= Zēria/Bēl&scaron;unu//&Scaron;alla"
