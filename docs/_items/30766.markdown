paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver with interest and for assessed field rent (<em>imittu</em>), to be delivered in dates.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 60 kor of dates and 25 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>. The dates are the assessed field rent on land (<em>imitti eqli</em>) located at the branch (<em>bābu</em>) of the old Kutha-canal. They should be delivered in Arahsamna (VIII) together with the usual by-products of the date cultivation: for each kor of dates he shall give (the customary amounts of) spathes (<em>tuhallu</em>), fibres (<em>mangagu</em>), (and) spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>), and a load of firewood (and) 2 <em>darīku</em>-containers. He should also pay for the <em>hab&ucirc; uhinni</em>-tax. On the 25 shekels that he owes he will have to pay a monthly interest of 1 shekel, in addition (<em>elat</em>) to the 10 shekels that he still owes (<em>10 &scaron;iqil kaspi mahru</em>). <strong>C</strong> acts as a guarantor for the payment (of the silver debts). There is still another (<em>elat</em>) claim against him that is still pending (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu mahrītu</em>). Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-uṣur&scaron;u/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl//Sasinnu; <strong>C </strong>= Nergal-uballiṭ"
