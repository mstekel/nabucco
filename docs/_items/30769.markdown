paraphrase: "Promissory note for barley and onions. Payment for a debt.<br /> <strong>B </strong>owes 4.1.4.0 kor of barley and 1010 strings (<em>gidlu</em>) of onions to <strong>A</strong>, slave of <strong>C</strong>. The onions should be delivered in one instalment in Nisan (I) in the creditor&rsquo;s house. In Ayyār (II), he should deliver the barley under the same conditions. In addition, there is an earlier claim (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) by the same creditor against the debtor and his brother and which is secured by the debtors&#39; mutual guarantee. Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Madānu-bēlu-uṣur, slave of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>B </strong>= Rēmūt-Bēl/Talīmu; <strong>C </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi"
