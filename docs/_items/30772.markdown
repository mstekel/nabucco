paraphrase: "Promissory note for revenue from impost on land, to be delivered in dates. Very fragmentary.<br /> The tablet is very badly preserved. No more than 3 lines are preserved on the obverse. From them it appears that someone whose name is lost owes 3;3 kor of dates to <strong>A</strong>. It is revenue from impost on land (<em>imittu</em>) which [broken off]. The description of the land&#39;s location is almost completely lost except for the mention of <em>&scaron;a</em> <em>&scaron;ib&scaron;u </em>and &quot;located next to <strong>C</strong>&quot;. The lower part of the obverse and upper part of the reverse are broken off. Name of 1 witness. The names of other witnesses are lost in the lacuna at the beginning of the reverse. Name of the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= [the name is broken off]; <strong>C </strong>= Gūzānu/Ninnea"
