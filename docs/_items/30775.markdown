He should deliver the dates in one instalment according to the 36 liters measure to the courtyard (<em>haṣāru</em>). Delivery is due in Arahsamna (VIII). He should also deliver the usual by-products of the date cultivation: for each kor of dates he shall give (the customary amounts of) spathes (<em>tuhallu</em>), spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>), and fibres (<em>mangagu</em>), a load of firewood, and 1 <em>darīku</em>-container. No payment has been received (<em>eṭēru</em> G Stat) for the gardener&#39;s remuneration (<em>&scaron;issinnu</em>) nor for the services of the agricultural supervisor (<em>gugallu</em>).
