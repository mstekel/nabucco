paraphrase: "Promissory note for dates.<br /> <strong>B</strong>, slave of <strong>C</strong>, owes 10 kor of dates to his master&#39;s brother (<strong>A</strong>), to be delivered in its full amount (<em>gamru</em>) in one instalment and measured according to the 36 liters measure. Delivery is due in Arahsamna (VIII) at the river in Babylon.&nbsp; Should he fail to deliver the full amount in dates, he will pay the remainder in silver according to the market price of Babylon. Witnesses.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nidintu-Bēl/Marduk-nāṣir-apli//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Madān-iddin, slave of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>C</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Egibi"
