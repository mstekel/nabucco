Investment in an onion-business partnership.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 2 minas and 40 shekels(*) of medium quality silver, of which one-eighth is alloy to <strong>A</strong>, to be delivered (in onions) as soon as possible (&quot;by the earliest boat&quot;, <em>eleppu haruptu</em>) in the next month, Nisan (I). Debtor and creditor are partners in a business venture (<em>harrānu</em>) with the latter being the investing and the former the acting partner. The above sum of silver comes in addition to (<em>elat</em>) the earlier business loan of 5 minas and 52 shekels (<em>&scaron;a ina muhhi harrāni</em>) and the already invested capital sum of 3 minas and 30 shekels (<em>&scaron;a harrāni</em>), so that now <strong>B</strong> has 12 minas of silver at his disposal to do business with. Regardless of the above, he should also deliver an additional (<em>nūptu</em>) 1000 strings of onions.
