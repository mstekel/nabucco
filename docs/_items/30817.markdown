paraphrase: "Promissory note for onion and silver. Fragmentary.<br /> <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> owe 10000 strings (<em>gidlu</em>) of onions and 10 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>(*). The onions should be delivered in Ayyār (II). The date of delivery for the silver is lost in the broken passages of the tablet. The verb is in the singular (<em>inamdin</em>) although its subject is plural (two debtors). Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Ah-iddin/Ardia (debtor).<br /> <br /> Notes: (*)Unclear whether it concerns onions and silver or onions worth 10 shekels of silver. In the latter case, note that the phrase <em>&scaron;īm kaspi </em>is lacking.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Ah-iddin/Ardia; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Balāṭu/Gimillu"
