paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver, barley and dates with interest.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 2 minas of silver; 45;0.0.0 kor of barley and 80;0.0.0 kor of dates to <strong>A</strong>, to be paid back in two installments. The barley should be delivered in Ayyār (II); the dates in Ta&scaron;rīt (VII); and on the silver he has to start paying the usual 20% interest on a monthly basis from next month onwards (lit. &quot;from the 1<sup>st</sup> of Intercalary Addar [XII2]&quot;). Delivery is due in the creditor&#39; countryhouse (<em>bītu ina ṣēri</em>). The debtor&#39;s land (<em>zēru</em>) planted with trees (<em>zaqpu</em>) and grain (<em>p&icirc; &scaron;ulpi</em>) in Bīt-ṭāb-Bēl and his house at the Borsippa canal are pledged to the creditor. No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged property until the creditor has received the full repayment of his silver, barley and dates. <strong>C</strong> acts as a guarantor for the repayment of the debt. The same creditor has also (<em>elat</em>) another claim (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) against him. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Marduk-mukīn-apli/&Scaron;umu-uṣur//Amēl-Ea.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-ahu-iddin; <strong>C</strong> = Nergal-u&scaron;allim/Arrabi"
