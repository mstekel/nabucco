paraphrase: "Receipt of a hireling from the head of the Egibi family. Paid on behalf of a third party.<br /> <strong>A</strong> receives (<em>mahāru</em>) a hireling (or: hirelings) (<em>agru</em>) from <strong>B</strong> for the account of (<em>ana muhhi</em>) <strong>C</strong> and his brothers, from whom the hireling was due. The hireling is probably needed for the performance of a certain job, during a well-defined period, apparently till the end of Arahsamna (VIII) of the 23<sup>rd</sup> year of Darius, based on the parallels of BM30764, BM31118 and BM31226, although the pertinent passage is broken off. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=&Scaron;umu-uṣur/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-ēṭir;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=&Scaron;irik/Iddinaya//Egibi (=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi);&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>=Nidintu/Kalbaya//Suhaya"
