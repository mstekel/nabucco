paraphrase: "About onions from property of Bēl in &Scaron;ahrīnu. Very fragmentary.<br /> Concerns onions from &Scaron;ahrīnu that are the prerogative of the temple of Bēl (<em>makkūru</em>), from the harvest of the 11<sup>th</sup> year of Darius. A promissory note* (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) regarding these onions had been concluded (<em>e&#39;ē</em><em>lu</em>), to the debit<sup>?</sup> of <strong>C</strong> ([<em>ina pani</em>]). The present document confirms that <strong>A</strong> received (<em>eṭēru </em>N) the onions from <strong>B</strong> and undertakes to bring along the promissory note and hand it over (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;-nadānu</em>) to &hellip; (broken off). Names of 7 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> *L. 1: <em>&uacute;</em>?<em>-</em>[<em>&iacute;l-t&iacute;</em>(me&scaron;)].<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>= &Scaron;addinnu/Madān-ahhē-<em>iddin;&nbsp;</em><strong>B</strong>=&nbsp;<em>...</em>/Bēl-uṣur&scaron;u;&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi"
