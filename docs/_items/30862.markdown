Silver had been transferred to the debtor to pay for <em>rikis qabli</em>. References to an outstanding debt of dates, onions and silver secured by pledge.<br /> <strong>B</strong> should pay 50 shekels of silver and 50 bundles of onions that are due from him to <strong>A</strong> in Nisan (I) of the 6<sup>th</sup> year. <strong>A</strong> will receive full repayment (<em>&scaron;alāmu</em>) from the <em>&scaron;ib&scaron;u</em>-crops from his field (<em>ina &scaron;ib&scaron;i eqli&scaron;u</em>). In addition (<em>elat</em>), there is an earlier promissory note (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) stating a claim (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) for 297<sup>!</sup>.3.0 kor of dates and 11.2.3 kor of barley.
