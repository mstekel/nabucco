paraphrase: "Receipt of silver from the head of the Egibi family. Partial payment of a debt on behalf of two other persons.<br /> The present document concerns a debt (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) of 16 minas of marked silver belonging to <strong>A</strong>, that was contracted to the debit of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> (<em>ina muhhi ~ e&rsquo;elu</em>) and for the payment of which <strong>C</strong> assumed warranty. We see <strong>D</strong> paying half of the indebted sum to the guarantor on behalf of (<em>ana muhhi</em>) the two debtors. <strong>C</strong> acknowledges his receipt (<em>mahāru</em>). The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each. Names of 8 witnesses and the scribe<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=Nab&ucirc;-uṣur&scaron;u/Gūzānu;&nbsp;<strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>=Rēmūt-Bēl/&Scaron;umu-ukīn;&nbsp;<strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>=Kīnaya/Dannu-ahhē&scaron;u-ibni&nbsp;<br /> <strong>C</strong>=Nīr-Yaw/Bēl-zēru-ibni;&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>=&Scaron;irku/Iddinaya//Egibi<sub> </sub>(=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi)"
