Witnessed by clerks of the Esagil temple<br /> <strong>B</strong> should pay 2 2/3 minas of white, medium-quality silver, of which 1/8 is alloy, that are due from him to <strong>A</strong> in Simān (III) of the 17<sup>th</sup> year in Babylon. He does not have to pay interest (<em>ina qaqqadi</em>). However, should he fail to meet the deadline, the debt will start to bear a yearly interest of 20% to be paid on a monthly basis.
