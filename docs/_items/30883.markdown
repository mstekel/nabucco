paraphrase: "Receipt for boat-toll.<br /> <strong>A</strong> receives payment for toll (<em>miksu)</em> from <strong>B</strong> for the boat loaded with onions that belongs to him. He should make the boat pass (the bridge/toll-house?) in Simān (III) and hand it back to <strong>B</strong>. The toll has been fully paid. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Bēl-rēmanni/Ṭābia//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Ninurta; <strong>B </strong>= Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n"
