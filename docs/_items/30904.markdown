paraphrase: "Promissory note for assessed field rent (<em>imittu</em>), to be delivered in dates.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 28 kor of dates to <strong>A</strong>, which is the assessed field rent on land (<em>imitti eqli</em>) located at the branch (<em>bābu</em>) of the old Kutha-canal. He should deliver the dates in one instalment according to the 36 liters measure to the courtyard. Deliver is due in Arahsamna (VIII). He should also deliver the usual by-products of the date cultivation: for each kor of dates he shall give (the customary amount of) spathes (<em>tuhallu</em>), spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>), (dates for) the <em>&scaron;ugarr&ucirc;</em>-supplement, (and) fibres (<em>mangagu</em>), a load of frewood and 1 <em>dar</em><em>īku</em>-container. No payment has been received (<em>eṭēru</em> G Stat) for the <em>hab&ucirc; uhinnu-</em>tax. In addition, there are promissory notes (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) for (still pending) claims (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) (by the same creditor). Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-uṣur&scaron;u/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl//Sasinnu"
