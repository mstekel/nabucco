paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Mutual warranty, general pledge, and third party guarantor.<br /> <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> owe 4 minas of silver of which one-eighth is alloy to <strong>A</strong> as payment for the tithes for the temples of Bēl, Nab&ucirc; and Nergal. He should pay in &Scaron;abāṭ (XI). The debt is secured in three ways. The debtors assume warranty for each other. All their property in and outside the city is pledged to the creditor. No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged properties until he has received the full repayment of his silver. Finally, <strong>C</strong> acts as a guarantor for the payment. Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Neriglissar/[...]; <strong>B<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Nā&rsquo;īd-Marduk/[...]//Eppe&scaron;-ilī; <strong>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Nab&ucirc;-zēru-iddin/[...]; <strong>B<sub>3 </sub></strong>= Kalbāya/[...]; <strong>C </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi"
