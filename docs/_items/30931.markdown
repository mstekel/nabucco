paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Mutual warranty.<br /> <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, his wife owe 1 mina and 11 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>. The two debtors assume warranty for each other. A broken passage mentions <strong>C</strong>, a slave, who apparently belongs to the debtors and is pledged as debt security.&nbsp; In addition, there is an earlier promissory note credited to <strong>A</strong> which is still pending. <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>D</strong> act as guarantors for the payment. Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>1 </sub></strong>= L&acirc;bā&scaron;i/Zēria//Nabāya; <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>= <sup>&nbsp;f</sup>Gula-qā&#39;i&scaron;at/Ea-ibni//Bēliyu, wife of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>C </strong>= Bēl-rēṣūa, slave of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>D </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-zeru-lī&scaron;ir"
