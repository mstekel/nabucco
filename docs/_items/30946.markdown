paraphrase: "Promissory note for dates. Fragmentary<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes a broken amount of dates to <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong>. The details of repayment are lost in the broken passages of the tablet. The little that is preserved refers to first-quality dates and what seems to be the place of deliver (starting with &quot;between ....&quot;).<br /> <br /> <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> =<sup>f</sup>Amat-Bāba/Kalbāya//Nabāya; <strong>B</strong> = Zababa-<em>x</em>/<sup>(f)?</sup>Amat-<em>x</em>"
