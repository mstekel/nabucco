paraphrase: "Promissory note for ploughshares.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes to <strong>A</strong> two bronze ploughshares (<em>&scaron;ūr&ucirc;</em>), the weight of the first one is 9 minas and the second one&#39;s&nbsp; is 4 [1/3] minas, to be delivered by the end of Nisan (I) of Darius&#39; 27<sup>th</sup> year. Should he fail to meet the deadline, he shall pay 1 mina of white silver instead of the two ploughshares on the 2<sup>nd </sup>of Ayyār of Darius&#39; 27<sup>th</sup> year. This sum corresponds to the ploughshares&#39; purchase price. Witnesses.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = &Scaron;i&scaron;ir (aka Marduk-nāṣir-apli)/Iddināya//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Ina-tē&scaron;&ecirc;-Nab&ucirc;/Nab&ucirc;<em>-x</em>//&Scaron;igūa"
