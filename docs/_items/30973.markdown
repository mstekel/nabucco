paraphrase: "Promissory note for dates and silver. Pledge of land. Fragmentary.<br /> The beginning of the tablet is broken off. Then we read that <strong>B</strong> owes 1 mina of silver and 24 kor of dates to <strong>A </strong>and are informed about the terms of repayment. The dates should be delivered in Arahsamna (VIII) in <strong>C</strong>&#39;s house (or: plot of land) (<em>bītu</em>) in &Scaron;uppatu. The silver should be paid without interest at the end of Addar (XII). The debtor&#39;s field (<em>eqlu</em>) located next to creditor&#39;s plot of land in &Scaron;uppatu is pledged to the creditor. No other creditor shall exercise any right over the pledged land until the debt is repaid in full. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: L&acirc;bā&scaron;i-Marduk/Kabtia//Egibi. First witness is Zabdiya, courtier <em>(&scaron;a rē&scaron;i</em>) of Cambyses he crown prince. Third witness is a son of the debtor (Nab&ucirc;-uṣur&scaron;u).<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Mukīn-Marduk/Arad-Nab&ucirc;//Asu; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-gimilanni."
