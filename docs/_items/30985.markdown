paraphrase: "A brief reminder (<em>tahsistu la ma&scaron;tu</em>) about payments for seeds. Reminder to the head of the head of the Egibi family.<br /> <strong>A</strong> reminds (<em>qab&ucirc;</em>) <strong>B</strong>* about the 10 shekels of white silver for sesame seeds (<em>&scaron;ama&scaron;&scaron;ammu</em>), and the 1/3 mina of white silver for mustard-seeds (<em>kas&ucirc;</em>). We cannot be sure that <strong>B</strong> was actually the &Scaron;irku whom we know from the Egibi family under his full name of Marduk-nāṣir-apli, son of Itti-Marduk-balāṭu. It should be noted that a man named Nergal-u&scaron;allim, son of Arrabi, is mentioned in relation with onions in BM30747: he received the <em>miksu-</em>toll from &Scaron;irku//Egibi for a boatload of onions. He may be <strong>A</strong>&#39;s son. However, no firm connection can be established between the current reminder about sesame and mustard-seeds that mentions Arrabi and BM 30747 about onions that mentions Nergal-u&scaron;allim/Arrabi.<br /> <br /> *l. 6: &Scaron;irku(?) (&Scaron;i-ir-DI)<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=Arrabi, father of Nab&ucirc;-bullissu;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=&Scaron;irku<sup>!</sup> (=?Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi)"
