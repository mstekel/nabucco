Partial repayment of a debt.<br /> <strong>A</strong> receives (<em>mahāru</em>) 1/2 mina of white silver from the debt (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) of 50 shekels of white silver, of which 1/8 is alloy, that <strong>B</strong> owes to <strong>A</strong>. He receives it from the debtor. The transaction took place under the auspices (<em>ina mahar</em>) of <strong>C</strong>, a judge (<em>dayyānu</em>). The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=&Scaron;irku/Iddinaya//Egibi<sub> </sub>(=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi);&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=Nab&ucirc;-kuzub-ilī/Bēl-rēmanni//Eppe&scaron;-ilī;&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>=Habaṣīru//Eppe&scaron;-ilī, (<em>dayyānu</em>)"
