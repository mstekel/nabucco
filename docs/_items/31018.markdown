paraphrase: "Receipt for silver. Payment of the purchase price for a house from a deposito.<br /> Concerns 1 1/2 mina of silver, not including a purse (that contains) 11 minas and 18 shekels of silver as price for a house belonging to <strong>A</strong>. The purse had been entrusted to <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> who died before <strong>A</strong> had taken out the silver from the deposito. This document has been written to aknowledge that <strong>A</strong> now <em>received</em> the 1 1/2 minas of silver from <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> (<strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>&lsquo;s son) and also took the purse away from him. He acted with <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s consent, whom we understand to be the original buyer&rsquo;s son (see TCL 12, 120). The background to this document is the sale of a house by <strong>A</strong> (seller) &nbsp;to <strong>D</strong> (buyer), who had deposited the purchase price with <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>. After the death of buyer and depositee, their sons settle the transfer of the silver to the seller. Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-rēmanni/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl//Ile&lsquo;&lsquo;i-Marduk; <strong>B1</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi, <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>&lsquo;s son; <strong>C</strong> = Marduk-balāssu-iqbi/Bēl-ahhē-iddin; <strong>D</strong> = Bēl-aḫḫē-iddin(/Marduk-zēru-ibni//Egibi), father of C"
