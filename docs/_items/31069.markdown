The rest of the document is broken off except for the short remark on the upper edge that the&nbsp; (indebted) silver is what <strong>C</strong> invested in a business partnership (with <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>) (<em>kaspu &scaron;a harrāni &scaron;a </em><strong>C</strong>).&nbsp;Apart from the names of 3 <em>ina uzuzzi</em> witnesses, no place or scribe are mentioned.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B </strong>= Lī&scaron;ir/Etel-p&icirc;//Bēl-nap&scaron;āti; <strong>C </strong>= Bunene-ibni"
