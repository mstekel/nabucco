paraphrase: "Promissory note for barley.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 40 kor of barley to <strong>A</strong>, to be delivered in Ayyār (II) at a place the details of which are lost in the broken passage at the beginning of the document. It was probably at a canal. The debtor should also pay for the transportation of the barley (from the canal?) to the (creditor&#39;s?) house. Witnesses.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iqī&scaron;a/PN<sub>2</sub>/Mudammiq-Adad; <strong>B</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi"
