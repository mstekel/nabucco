paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 11 1/2 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>, to be paid without interest in Simān (III). In addition, there is an earlier promissory note for 3 old and empty barrels. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Bēl-aplu-iddin/Zēria//Bēl-aplu-uṣur.<br /> This tablet is probably a retroact.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = &Scaron;āpik-zēri/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-iddin//Nādin-&scaron;e&#39;im; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-tultab&scaron;i-lī&scaron;ir/Bēl-zēru-ibni//Nappāhu&nbsp;"
