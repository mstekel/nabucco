paraphrase: "Receipt of silver by a member of the Egibi family. Payment for <em>rikis qabli</em>.<br /> <strong>A</strong> receives (<em>mahāru</em>) 1 mina of white silver, of which 1/8 is alloy, from <strong>B</strong>, paid for <em>rikis qabli</em> since (<em>ultu</em>) the 24<sup>th</sup> year. <strong>A</strong> has not yet received payment for the debt (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) of what remains (<em>rēhu</em>) to be paid for the <em>rikis qabli</em> of the 23<sup>rd</sup> year, a claim (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) still held by <strong>A</strong> against <strong>B</strong>. There exists a previous tablet (<em>giṭṭu</em>) regarding the <em>rikis qabli</em> for the 23<sup>rd</sup> year, viz. for 1 mina of silver. The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=<em>Nab&ucirc;</em>-ahhē-bulliṭ/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=Nab&ucirc;-zēru-ibni/Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu//Egibi"
