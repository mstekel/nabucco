paraphrase: "Exchange<sup>?</sup> of boats.<br /> The document opens by referring to two boats: a boat with a width of 6 cubīts at its beam (<em>&scaron;aburru</em>), which has <em>run aground</em>? (<em>ṭu-bu-&uacute; </em>[<em>ṭab&ucirc;</em> D]) at the bank (<em>nabalkattu</em>), and a boat with a width of 6 1/2 cubīts at its beam, which is part of a (pontoon-) bridge (<em>gi&scaron;ru</em>). It continues by referring to a third boat, as follows: <em>- which</em>/<em>of -, </em>one boat (<em>&scaron;a i&scaron;tēt eleppu</em>) with a width of 5 cubīts at its beam, which belongs to <strong>A</strong>. The document then states: with each &quot;other have exchang (<em>itti ahāme&scaron; &scaron;upēl&ucirc;</em>)&quot;, thus referring to the exchange of the first two boats with the third one, although it is not entirely clear who is meant by &quot;they&quot; (probably <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>). The document concludes by stating that <strong>B</strong> assumes warranty for the <em>u&scaron;k&ucirc;tu</em> of the <em>run aground</em>? boat and the boat of the (pontoon)-bridge. Names of 5 witnesses. The scribe is &Scaron;irku/Iddinaya//Egibi (=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi).<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=Kāṣiru/Ipria//Marduk-abu&scaron;u; <strong>B</strong>=Bēl-upahhir/Bāba-ēre&scaron;//Mudammiq-Adad"
