paraphrase: "Receipt of silver from the head of the Egibi family.<br /> <strong>A</strong> receives (<em>eṭēru</em>) 2 minas of medium quality silver, of which 1/8 is alloy, from <strong>B</strong>. It is the remainder (<em>rīhtu</em>) of probably 4 minas 10 shekels of silver (1+x minas x shekels.) that belongs to (<em>mala &scaron;</em>a) <strong>C</strong> and his brothers<sup>?</sup> and &ldquo;which they gave to <strong>B</strong> for 2 1/2 minas of silver&rdquo; (<em>&scaron;a ana</em> <strong>B</strong> <em>ana</em> 2 1/2&nbsp;<em>mana kaspu iddinu</em>). Granted that this refers to the brothers&rsquo; sale of a slave to <strong>B</strong> a year ago for 4 minas and 10 shekels (BM30927), we may surmise that the sale was meant to raise the cash needed to pay the sellers&rsquo; creditor (<strong>A</strong>). Accordingly, <strong>B</strong> was told by the sellers to pay directly to <strong>A</strong>, which de facto happens in three installments: a payment of 1/2 mina in BM77848, the current payment of 2 minas, and the remainder of 1 1/2 minas in Abraham2004001. The current payment covers the capital sum (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) and its interest (<em>hubullu</em>). Upon receipt of the silver <strong>A </strong>promptly hands over (<em>ki utirri!* ...</em> <em>ittadin</em> [<em>t&acirc;ru </em>D<em>-nadānu</em>]) the promissory note (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) for the 2 1/2 minas of silver to <strong>B</strong>. He already (<em>elat</em>) handed over the register (<em>giṭṭu</em>) regarding the 1 1/2 minas of silver to <strong>B</strong> (Abraham2004001).
