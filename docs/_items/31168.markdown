paraphrase: "Receipt for forced labourers.<br /> <strong>A</strong> receives (<em>mahāru</em>)&nbsp;2 forced labourers (<em>ur</em><em>ā&scaron;u</em>) from <strong>B</strong>. They are to do the earthwork (<em>dullu epiri</em>) that<em>&nbsp;</em><strong>C, B</strong>&#39;s son-in-law, is supposed to do&nbsp;(<em>&scaron;a </em>C)&nbsp;from Arahsamna (VIII) till the end of Nisan (I) of Nabonidus&rsquo; 13th<sup>sic?!</sup> year. The document is written on the 9th day of Arahsamna (VIII) of Nabonidus&rsquo; 12th<sup>sic?!</sup> year, which means that the labourers will start working only in another year time (unless there is an error in the copy, and they are to start immediately). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe:&nbsp;Arad-Marduk/Kittia//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Ea.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>=&hellip;-u&scaron;allim/Apkallu//Mu&scaron;ēzib; <strong>B </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>C </strong>= Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n"
