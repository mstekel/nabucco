paraphrase: "Receipt for silver. Payment for a debt secured by antichretic pledge of a slave. &nbsp;<br /> <strong>B1</strong> and <strong>fB2</strong>, his wife, owe 30 shekels of silver to <strong>fA2</strong>. In the present document, the creditor&rsquo;s mother (<strong>fA1</strong>) receives repayment of this debt from the debtors. The debt was secured by the pledge of a slave (<strong>fC</strong>) which <strong>fB2</strong>, one of the debtors, received as security for her claim against <strong>D</strong>. We assume that this slave was released from pledge upon its repayment. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> f<strong>A1</strong> = fEtellitu/Marduk-&scaron;umu-ibni//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu, mother of f<strong>A2</strong>; f<strong>A2</strong> = fIna-Esagila-bēlet/Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;allim//Irani; <strong>B1</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-zēri/Ina-tē&scaron;&ecirc;-eṭir/Ēṭiru; f<strong>B2</strong> = Bunanītu/Na&#39;id-Marduk/Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;, wife of <strong>B1</strong>; f<strong>C </strong>= f&Scaron;alam-dininni, slave of <strong>D</strong>; <strong>D </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-tultab&scaron;i-lī&scaron;ir/Bēl-zēru-ibni//Nappāhu"
