paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver with interest. General pledge.<br /> <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> owe 12 minas of silver with interest to <strong>A</strong>. The present document stipulates that from the 1st of &Scaron;abāṭ (XI) onwards (i.e., from now on) an interest of 20% should be paid on a monthly basis. The three debtors assume warranty for each other and pledge their entire property in and outside the city. No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged objects until the creditor has received the full repayment of the capital amount and its interest. In addition, there is an earlier promissory note but at this point the document is broken off. Furthermore, another promissory note of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> for 1 mina and 30 shekels of silver is mentioned [broken off] to be paid to/for [broken off] of the king. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe: Aplāya/M-u&scaron;allimMarduk.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;aya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = &Scaron;umu-iddin/Zēria/&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Gula; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nergal-uballiṭ/Tabnēa/X; <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> = Kidinnu/Zēria/&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Gula"
