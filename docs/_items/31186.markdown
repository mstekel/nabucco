paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Pledge of house with antichresis.<br /> <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and his wife (<strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong>) owe 2 minas of silver to <strong>A</strong>, slave of <strong>C</strong>. The payment is secured by the pledge of the debtors&rsquo; house in the Hubur-street, next to the houses of <strong>D</strong> and <strong>E</strong>. According to the current document, the house will serve as antichretic pledge for the silver debt. Thus, the creditor should not pay rent for the house to the debtors because the rent meant to cover the interest which is fixed at 12 shekels of silver per mina on a yearly basis. No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the debtors until <strong>A</strong> has received the full repayment of his debt, namely, 2 minas of silver. The two debtors assume warranty for each other and the one who has silver available at the due date will pay. The document concludes by poining out that debt has accrued interest since the 2<sup>nd</sup> of Arahsamna (VIII) (i.e., the previous day). Witnesses.<br /> <br /> <strong>A </strong>= Nergal-rēṣūa, slave of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>B<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Bēl-tuta&scaron;lim/Andahar; <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>= <sup>f</sup>&Scaron;ini-banȃ/Ninlil-zēru-tabni, wife of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>C </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi;<strong> D </strong>= Nādin/Hanunu; <strong>E </strong>= [P]N/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/P[N]."
