paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Pledge of persons (slaves?).<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 1 mina and 10 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>, to be paid without interest (<em>qaqqadu</em>) on the 1<sup>st</sup> of Simān (III), i.e. in another 17 days. The payment is secured by the pledge of two women (most likely slaves): <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong>, her daughter. No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged persons until <strong>A</strong> has received the full repayment of his debt. Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= Iqī&scaron;a/Egibi (sic!)//Rē&#39;i-sis&ecirc;; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1 </sub></strong>= <sup>f</sup>Nanāya-kilīlu-uṣur (slave?! of <strong>B</strong>); <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2 </sub></strong>= <sup>f</sup>Tabluṭu, daughter of <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong>."
