paraphrase: "Promissory note for assessed field rent (<em>imittu</em>), to be delivered in dates.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes x+2 kor of dates to <strong>A</strong>, the assessed field rent on land (<em>imitti eqli</em>) located at the Zabunu-ditch that extends till [broken off]. It is <strong>A</strong>&#39;s [x-]th share in the income to which he is entitled together with his brothers (<strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>). The dates should be delivered to the courtyard according to the 36 liters measure of the creditor. Delivery is due in Arahsamna (VIII). <strong>B</strong> should also deliver the usual by-products of the date cultivation: for each kor of dates he shall give a load of spathes (<em>tuhallu</em>), spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>), and fibres (<em>mangagu</em>), 1 <em>dar</em><em>īku</em>-container and 1 load of firewood. No payment has been received (<em>eṭēru</em> G Stat) for the gardener&#39;s remuneration (<em>&scaron;issinnu</em>). In Ayyār (II), he will deliver 1 kor of [broken off]. The document seems to end with an <em>elat</em>-clause but the passage is badly preserved. Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= Bēl-iddin/[PN]; <strong>C<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-bulliṭ, brother of <strong>A</strong>; <strong>C<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Nergal-u&scaron;ēzib, brother of <strong>A</strong>"
