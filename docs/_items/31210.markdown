paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Very fragmentary.<br /> <strong>B </strong>owes 2 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>, slave of <strong>C</strong>. The clause about the terms of repayment is too fragmentarily preserved to understand its details. Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-uterri, slave of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>B </strong>= Ahu-edul-amur(?)/[P]N; <strong>C </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi"
