paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Pledge of a house in antichresis. Fragmentary.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 5/6 minas and 5 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>, servant of <strong>C</strong>. The debtor&rsquo;s share in a house that is located next to <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s house is pledged to <strong>A</strong> in lieu of paying interest (antichretic pledge). Thus, the creditor should not pay house rent. This is followed by a fragmentarily preserved passage stating that &quot;yearly [&hellip;] Nisan [&hellip;]&quot;. The document concludes by pointing out that no other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged house, until <strong>A</strong> has received the full repayment of his debt. Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Bēl-rēṣūa, servant of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>B </strong>= Marduk-erība/Rēmūt//Miṣrāya(?); <strong>C </strong>= Neriglissar; <strong>D </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi"
