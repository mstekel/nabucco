paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver without interest <em>(nishu</em>-loan). Pledge of house. Related to a past deposit of silver from a house sale.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 6 minas of silver to <strong>A</strong>, to be paid without interest (<em>qaqqadu</em>) in Addar (XII). The debtor&#39;s main house in which he is living is pledged to the creditor. No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged house until the creditor has received the full repayment of the debt. The loaned silver originates from silver that had been put in a bag (<em>himtu)</em> and entrusted (<em>paqādu</em>) to <strong>B</strong>&#39;s father by the buyer of <strong>A</strong>&#39;s house in the past. On the same day that the present document is issued the chief officials (<em>rab&ucirc;</em>) and the judges (<em>dayyānu</em>) authorized <strong>B </strong>to give the bag to <strong>A</strong> (apparently after <strong>B</strong>&#39;s father died) (cf. MNB1133 = TCL 12, 120). <strong>A </strong>subsequently lent from this silver to <strong>B</strong> for expenses (<em>nishu</em>). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Ile&#39;&#39;i-Marduk/Bēl-upahhir//Eppe&scaron;-ilī.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Bēl-rēmanni/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl//Ile&#39;&#39;i-Marduk; <strong>B </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>C </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi, father of <strong>B</strong>"
