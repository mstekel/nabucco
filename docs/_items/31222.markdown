paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver without interest, within the framework of a business partnership (<em>harrānu</em>)<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 12 shekels of silver to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>. It is silver that <strong>C</strong> invested in a business partnership (<em>harrānu) </em>and used for the purchase (<em>&scaron;īmu</em>) of a draught animal (a cow) (<em>litti nīri</em>) and its calf. In Addar (XII), he should pay the silver, with an alloy of one-eighth percent, (<em>kaspa &scaron;a bitqa)</em>. He does not have to pay interest (<em>qaqqadu</em>). The payment is secured by the pledge of the debtor&rsquo;s onion field (<em>&scaron;ikittu</em>). Names of two witnesses and the scribe: Marduk-&scaron;umu-uṣur/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-&scaron;umu-ukīn/Sagdidi.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Bēl-īpu&scaron;/Rā&scaron;il//Nappāhu; <strong>A<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Madān-&scaron;umu-iddin/Zēria//Nabāya; <strong>B </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-zēri/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-ibni//Pahāru; <strong>C </strong>= Iddin-Marduk"
