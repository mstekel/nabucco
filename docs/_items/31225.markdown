paraphrase: "Promissory note for assessed field rent (<em>imittu</em>), to be delivered in dates.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 33 kor of dates to <strong>A</strong> and his brothers, the assessed field rent on land (<em>imitti </em>[<em>eqli</em>]) located at the Zabunu-ditch, next to <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s [plot of land]. He should deliver the dates in one nstalment according to the 36 liters measure to the courtyard (<em>haṣāru</em>). Delivery is due in Arahsamna (VIII). He should also deliver the usual by-products of the date cultivation: for each kor of dates he shall give a load of spathes (<em>tuhallu</em>), spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>) and fibres (<em>mangagu)</em>, 2 <em>darīku</em>-containers and 1 load of firewood. In addition, there is an earlier claim (by the same creditor) against B which is still pending. No payment has been received (<em>eṭēru</em> G Stat) for the gardener&#39;s remuneration (<em>&scaron;issinnu</em>). Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>A<sub>2 </sub></strong>= brother of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>B </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-iddin/Kīnāya;"
