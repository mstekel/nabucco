paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Payment in dates. Renewal of (general) pledge.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 30 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>, to be paid in Arahsamna (VIII) in the form of dates, calculated at the market price of &Scaron;ahrinu. The dates should be delivered in one instalment by boat(s) at the Borsippa canal. All of the debtor&#39;s property in and outside the city that were already pledged to the creditor, including his sluice gates (<em>bābu</em>), remain pledged. In addition, there are earlier promissory notes for silver, barley, dates and onions. The (indebted) silver is what has been paid for the <em>rikis qabli </em>of D&ucirc;zu (IV) of Nabonidus&#39; 9<sup>th</sup> year. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Bēl-uballiṭ/&Scaron;āpik-zēri//Ile&rsquo;&rsquo;i Marduk.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu/Zēria"
