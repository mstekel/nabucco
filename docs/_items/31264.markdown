paraphrase: "Receipt of an <em>ilku</em>-payment (and)<sup>?</sup> the advance payment on the bow-tax (<em>pānāt</em> <em>qa&scaron;ti</em>) by the head of the Egibi family. Paid on behalf of a third party.<br /> <strong>A</strong> receives payment (<em>eṭēru</em>) from <strong>B</strong> for the account of (<em>ana muhhi</em>) <strong>C</strong>, his brother, for the <em>ilku</em>-tax till the end of Addar (XII) of Darius&rsquo; 26<sup>th</sup> year that is due from the latter and <sup>l&uacute;</sup><em>ṭi-pi-ni-&scaron;&uacute;</em>*. A short remark at the very end of the obverse, before the witness list, states that he (also<sup>?</sup>)** receives (<em>eṭēru</em>) an advance payment on the bow-tax (<em>panāt qa&scaron;ti</em>). The exact amounts that are paid are not specified. The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each. Names of 6 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> *<em>ṭi-pi-ni-&scaron;&uacute;</em> probably refers to <strong>C</strong>&#39;s additional men. (cf. BM30589)<br /> **The verb of receipt (<em>ēṭir</em>) occurs twice: once with <em>ilku &scaron;a</em> <strong>C</strong> (ll. 1-6) and once with <em>pānāt qa&scaron;ti</em> (l. 7) as direct object. These could be seen as two different taxes or service obligations, or the latter could be a specification of the more general <em>ilku</em>.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = &Scaron;irku/Iddinaya//Egibi (=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi);&nbsp;<strong>B&nbsp;</strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ittannu/Bānia//Itinnu; <strong>C</strong> = Rēmūt-Bēl/Bānia//Itinnu"
