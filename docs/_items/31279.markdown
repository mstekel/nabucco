paraphrase: "Undertaking to bring along a baker to the head of the Egibi family. Very fragmentary.<br /> The tablet&#39;s obverse side and the beginning of its reverse are too fragmentary to understand what the text is about. The part that is better preserved cites the words that were spoken by someone whom we identify as <strong>A</strong> (&quot;I will bring&quot;, <em>abāku</em>), and continues by stipulating that in case he fails to bring along the baker(s) (<em>mubann&ucirc;</em>) and deliver him to <strong>B</strong>**, he should give him two other men instead (<strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>), as had been agreed in a previous document (<em>&scaron;aṭaru</em>). Names of 7 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> ** <em>kī</em> <sup>l&uacute;</sup>M[U ...] <em>la</em> [<em>itab</em>]<em>akkamma ana</em> PN [<em>la ittadin</em>]<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=<em>...-Marduk</em>?;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=Marduk-nāṣir-apli (=?Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi);&nbsp;<strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>=<em>Iqī&scaron;a<sup>?</sup></em>-Marduk;&nbsp;<strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>=Nab&ucirc;-zēru-ibni/A&scaron;&scaron;ur-abu-uṣur"
