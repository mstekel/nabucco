paraphrase: "Promissory note to pay a debt of silver and onions.<br /> <strong>B</strong> should pay 15 shekels of marked silver of the kind commonly used for purchases and sales (<em>nadānu u mahāru</em>) and 15 bundles of onions that are due from him, to <strong>A</strong> in Nisan (I). He does not have to pay interest (<em>ina qaqqadi</em>) on the silver. Related to the archive of the Egibi family on prosopographical reasons (cf. BM 30838 [=Dar 318]). Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=Marduk-bēl&scaron;unu/Arad-Marduk//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Ea; <strong>B</strong>=Iddinnaya/Arad-Bēl"
