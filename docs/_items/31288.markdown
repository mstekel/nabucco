paraphrase: "Security for debt. Payment due from the head of the Egibi family. Interest and pledge.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 10 1/2 minas and 5 shekels of medium quality silver, of which 1/8 is alloy to <strong>A</strong>. The present document stipulates that from Addar (XII) onwards a yearly interest of 20% should be paid on a monthly basis. We learn that this debt, together with one of (<em>adi</em>) 3 2/3 minas and 5 shekels of silver, are what remains (<em>rīhtu</em>) to be paid (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) to <strong>A</strong> for the onions that he sold (<em>mahāru</em>) to <strong>B</strong>. It concerns the onions of Darius&#39; 11<sup>th</sup> year, for which probably compare BM30721 (=Dar 315). The debtor&#39;s acreage (<em>zēru</em>) in Bīt-Hahhuru, located next to <strong>C</strong>, is pledged till the full repayment of the capital sum and its interest.
