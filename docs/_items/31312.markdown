The first one correponds to 2/3 mina and 4 shekels, which <strong>C</strong> entrusted to <strong>B</strong> as payment for <strong>A</strong>; then, he is also given 14 shekels of silver, as income (<em>kaspu </em><em>&scaron;a ēreb qātī</em>). Altogether, <strong>A</strong> receives from <strong>B</strong> 58 (text: 57) shekels of silver. Witnesses<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Bēl-ahu-u&scaron;ab&scaron;i/Etellu; <strong>B </strong>= Kalbāya/Ṣillāya//Nabāya; <strong>C </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi"
