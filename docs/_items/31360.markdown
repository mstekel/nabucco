paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver with interest, within the framework of a business partnership (<em>harrānu</em>).<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes silver to <strong>A</strong>, but the amount and other details are lost in the broken part at the beginning of the tablet. It is silver that <strong>C</strong> invested in a business partnership (with <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>) and is to be used for the purchase (<em>&scaron;īmu</em>) of onions. <strong>B</strong> should pay the silver and the interest on it (<em>hubullu</em>) in Nisan (I). It should be entirely taken (<em>&scaron;alāmu </em>G) from the income from his onion field (<em>&scaron;ikittu</em>). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Zēr-Bābili/Aplāya//&Scaron;umu-lib&scaron;i.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Madān-&scaron;umu-iddin/Zēria]//Nabāya; <strong>B </strong>= Iddiya/Nab&ucirc;-rēmanni; <strong>C </strong>= Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n"
