paraphrase: "Promissory note for dates. Payment for military service. Pledge of slaves and land.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 160 kor of dates to <strong>A</strong>, to be delivered in its full amount (<em>gamru</em>) in Arahsamna (VIII) at the river in Babylon. Delivery is secured by the pledge of the debtor&#39;s houseborn slaves (<strong>F<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>F<sub>2</sub></strong>) and his field (<em>eqlu</em>) at the Biri canal (<em>pattu</em> GN). No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged salves and land until the debt is fully paid back. Background to the above debt is the payment (by <strong>A</strong>) to <strong>C</strong> for performing military service (on <strong>B</strong>&#39;s behalf) (<em>ana madakti alāku).</em>Besides (<em>itt&ucirc;</em>) the 160 kor of dates, the debtor should deliver 20 loads of firewood.<br /> The two earlier promissory notes for dates and 12 shekels of silver have been annulled (<em>hep&ucirc;</em>). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Nab&ucirc;-bān-ahi/Apkallu//A&scaron;lāku.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun/Bēl-ahhē-iqī&scaron;a//Sipp&ecirc;(a); <strong>C</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl; <strong>F<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-kuṣranni, slave of <strong>B</strong>; <strong>F<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bēl-ṣull&ecirc;-&scaron;emu, slave of <strong>B</strong>"
