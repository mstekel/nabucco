paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver without interest. Payment in instalments. General pledge.<br /> <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> owe 2 minas and 28 2/3 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>, to be paid without interest in two instalments: almost half of it (1 mina and 8 shekels of silver) should be paid in D&ucirc;zu (IV) and the rest in Addar (XII). The debtors pledge all their property in and outside the city, and assume warranty for each other. &nbsp;The creditor swore before &Scaron;ama&scaron; that he agrees <em>to take back the silver in instalments</em> (?) (<em>mīni &scaron;a kaspi na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>). In addition, there are 4 1/2 shekels of silver at <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>&#39;s disposal (<em>ina pāni</em>).
