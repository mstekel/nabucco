paraphrase: "Renting of a boat and receipt of the rent money. Rented to the head of the Egibi family.<br /> <strong>A</strong> rents (<em>ana idi nadānu</em>) his boat to <strong>B</strong> and receives (<em>eṭēru</em>) 1/3 mina of white, medium quality silver as rent money (<em>idū</em>) and (<em>adi</em>) for the boat&rsquo;s maintenance (<em>kurummatu</em>). The boat will sail to Bi&scaron;tu-&scaron;a-ṣēru&rsquo;a, but should not pass (<em>etēqu</em>) the fortified settlement (<em>birtu</em>); if the boat passes it, the renter shall pay an additional 5 minas of silver. The boat is currently at the disposal of <strong>C</strong> (<em>ina pāni</em>) for boat-service duty (<em>mallāhūtu</em>). It is not specified when the boat will be made available to the renter (unlike in BM30490; BM31316 e.a.). The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=Iddin-Nab&ucirc;;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=&Scaron;irik/Iddinaya//Egibi (=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi);&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>=&Scaron;ama&scaron;-iddin/Bēl-iddin"
