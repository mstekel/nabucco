paraphrase: "Promissory note to pay a debt of silver, barley and onions to the head of the Egibi family. Pledge renewal. Repayment of the onions is to be obtained from the debtor&rsquo;s income from impost on land. Silver had been transferred to the debtor to pay for <em>rikis qabli</em>. Reference to an outstanding debt of dates and barley secured by pledge.<br /> <strong>B</strong> should deliver 3 5/6 minas and 7 &frac12; shekels of silver, 2 kor of barley and 130 bundles of onions that are due from him to <strong>A</strong>. The silver and the onions should be delivered in Nisan (I) of the 6<sup>th</sup> year. In Ayyar (II) of the same year he should deliver the full amount (<em>gamru</em>) of indebted barley, in one instalment according to <strong>A</strong>&#39;s measure. All (<em>gabbu</em>) the previously pledged (<em>bīt ma&scaron;kanu</em>) fields planted with trees (<em>eqlu</em> <em>zaqpu</em>) and grain (<em>p&icirc; &scaron;ulpi</em>), from the Borsippa Canal to the Royal Street, are pledged (anew) to <strong>A</strong> (<em>ma&scaron;kanu</em>). No other creditor shall exercise any rights over these until <strong>A</strong> has received full repayment of his credit claim. In addition (<em>elat</em>), there is a previous promissory note (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) for 297.3.0 kor of dates and 11.2.3 kor of barley owed to <strong>A</strong> (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) for which the above mentioned fields have been taken as pledge (<em>ma&scaron;kanu ṣabātu</em>). The (indebted) silver is that which has been given (<em>nadānu</em>, G Stat.) to finance work (<em>dullu</em>) at the dams (<em>mu&scaron;ennītu</em>), within the framework of payments for <em>rikis qabli</em> of the 5<sup>th</sup> year. <strong>A</strong> will receive full repayment of the onions from his (=the debtor&#39;s) income from the <em>&scaron;ib&scaron;u</em>-impost on an onion-field (<em>ina &scaron;ib&scaron;i eqli&scaron;u</em> <em>&scaron;a &scaron;ūmi</em>). The field (and the collection of impost from it) is managed by <strong>C</strong> (<strong>A</strong>&#39;s slave) (<em>epē&scaron;u</em> G, lit. &quot;to contract to do perform certain tasks&quot;)). The upper sector belongs to <strong>B</strong>; the lower sector, which is located next to the house of the Canal Inspector (<sup>l&uacute;</sup>AGRIG<em> </em>[<em>ma&scaron;ennu</em>]), is shared with <strong>D</strong>.
