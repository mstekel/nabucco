paraphrase: "Lease of a share in the right to collect toll from boats. Leased out by the head of the Egibi family and his co-shareholder to two individuals. The right to collect toll ultimately belonged to the Governor of Babylon.<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> lease (<em>ana sūti nadānu</em>) the right to collect toll from boats going downstream and upstream at the bridge and the harbour to <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, for a monthly payment of 15 shekels of white, medium quality silver, of which 1/8 is alloy. They should demand toll (<em>esēru</em>) from the boats which moor (<em>i-ki-il-la-a&#39;</em> [<em>kal&ucirc;</em> ]) at the bridge, are not allowed to pass on the monthly income (<em>erbu</em>) from the bridge without <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>&#39; s consent, and should show him and the guardians any written message (<em>na&scaron;partu</em>) concerning the bridge. The collection of toll (<em>isirtu, usirtu</em>) from said bridge is the prerogative (<em>bīt qipti</em>) of <strong>C</strong>, but <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> managed it (<em>ina pani</em>). He had a half-share in it (<em>ahi zittu</em>), with 5 bridge guardians (<em>maṣṣārū</em> <em>gi&scaron;ri</em>) being the other share-holders (i.e. <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong>D<sub>3</sub></strong> and <strong>D<sub>4</sub></strong>).
