paraphrase: "Receipt for dates. Partial payment.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 20;2.4.0 kor (c. 3,696 l) of dates to <strong>A</strong>. In the present document the creditor receives part of this debt, namely 7;2.3.0 kor (c. 1,350 l) from the debtor. The latter should also prove that he handed over (<em>nad</em><em>ānu</em>) dates to <strong>C</strong> in three days (till the 26th of Ta&scaron;rīt [VII]): if he fails to do so, he will have to pay the full amount of (<strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s) claim for dates of the 12th year in the 6 liters*-measure. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> *0;0.1 kor = 1 sūtu.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B </strong>= Padāya/Ezida-...; <strong>C </strong>= Arad-Bēl"
