paraphrase: "Receipt for silver. Purchase price for (pledged) slaves, paid by the creditor to the debtor.<br /> Concerns three female slaves: <strong>fD1</strong> and her two children (i.e. <strong>fD2</strong> and a baby): <strong>A</strong>, who previously took them from <strong>C</strong> paying him 1 mina of silver, now receives the same sum from <strong>B</strong>, meaning that he allows <strong>B</strong> (his creditor) to buy the slaves from him in order to cover his debt to him. <strong>A</strong> has promptly given the three slaves to <strong>B</strong>: should any previous promissory note related to these three slaves be found in <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s house, this will belong to <strong>B</strong>. Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= &Scaron;umāya/Nab&ucirc;-zēru-iddin//Dābibī; <strong>C </strong>= Bēl-iddin/Silim-Bēl/Damqu; f<strong>D1</strong> = fHabaṣirtu; f<strong>D2</strong>, = fBānītu-taddin daughter of f<strong>D1</strong>"
