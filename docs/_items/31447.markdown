paraphrase: "Receipt for dates.<br /> <strong>A</strong> <em>receives</em> 9 kor (c. 1,620 l) of dates from <strong>B,</strong> which the latter owe to him according to the promissory note that is with <strong>A</strong>. The remainder of the document is broken off.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-balāssu-iqbi/Mura&scaron;&ucirc;/Bunnāya; <strong>B </strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi"
