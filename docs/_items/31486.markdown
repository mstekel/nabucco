paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Pledge of a slave.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 1/3(?) minas and 8 2/3 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>, slave of <strong>C</strong>, to be paid without interest (<em>qaqqadu</em>) in Nisan (I) of Nabonidus&rsquo; 12<sup>th</sup> year. The payment is secured by the pledge of the debtor&rsquo;s slave (<strong>D</strong>). No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged slave until <strong>A</strong> has received the full repayment. The (indebted) silver is the rest of an earlier debt of 3 minas of silver which was owed by the debtor&#39;s father. Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-uterri, slave of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>B </strong>= Silīm-Bēl/Rēmūt; <strong>C </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>D </strong>= Lūṣi-ana-nūri, slave of <strong>B</strong>."
