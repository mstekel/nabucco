Temple income.<br /> <strong>B</strong>, slave of <strong>C</strong>, owes a broken amount of dates (x+5.0.0.0 kor) to <strong>A</strong>, a temple oblate (<em>&scaron;irku &scaron;a Nab&ucirc;</em>). It is the assessed field rent (?) (<em>imitti </em>[<em>eqli</em>]) of land in Borsippa (?) ([<em>&scaron;&aacute;</em><sup>?</sup>] <em>Barsip</em>), income of the Nab&ucirc;-temple (<em>makkūr</em> <em>Nab&ucirc;</em>). <strong>B</strong> should deliver the full amount (<em>gamru) </em>of dates in Ta&scaron;rīt (VII) at the courtyard (<em>haṣāru</em>) according to his master&#39;s measure, which is a measure of 5 (units) per kor (or, in other words, a 36 liters measure with 5 PI = 1 kor).
