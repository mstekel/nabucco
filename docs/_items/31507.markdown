paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 10 shekels of stamped(?) silver (<em>ginnu</em>), used for purchases and sales (<em>nadānu u mahāru</em>), to <strong>A</strong>, to be paid in &Scaron;abāṭ (XI). In addition, there is an earlier promissory note for 7 kor of dates. The present document states that the return of that earlier (already) paid promissory note has not yet occurred. Witnesses.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-iddin/Kīnāya"
