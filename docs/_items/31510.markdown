paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 36 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>, to be paid in its full amount (<em>gamāru </em>D<em>-ma eṭēru</em>) by the end of Ta&scaron;rīt (VII). The creditor shall take (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) the equivalent of the indebted silver from silver with one-fifth alloy (<em>&scaron;īm kaspi hamu&scaron;tu</em>, wr. <em>ha-a<sup>?</sup>-mu-&scaron;u</em>-x), as much as can be cashed (<em>mala i-ru-bu</em>). A fragmentarily preserved passage at the end of the document seems to refer to a business partnership between the partners. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe: L&acirc;bā&scaron;i/Bēl-&scaron;arru-uṣur//Arad-Ea.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Kalbāya/Marduk-nāṣir; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;allim"
