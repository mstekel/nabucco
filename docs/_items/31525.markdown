paraphrase: "Promissory note for onions.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 2200 bundles of onions to <strong>A</strong>, to be delivered in Nisan (I) in the creditor&#39;s house. The onions should be of good quality (<em>babban&ucirc;</em>). In addition, there is an earlier claim (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) by the same creditor that is still pending. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Bēl-iddin/Nab&ucirc;-mu&scaron;ētiq-udd&ecirc;//Sagdidi.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = &Scaron;umu-iddin/Mukīn-zēri"
