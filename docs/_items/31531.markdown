paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. General pledge.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 3 minas and 48 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>, to be paid without interest on the 25<sup>th</sup> of &Scaron;abāṭ (XI). All his property in and outside the city are pledged to the creditor until the full repayment of the debt. In addition, there is a previous claim (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) by the same creditor. The (indebted) silver is the part (<em>pūtu</em>) of the price that <strong>A</strong> received (<em>mahāru</em>) together with (his business partner) <strong>C</strong> for their sale of building plots (<em>qan&ucirc;</em>). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: .../Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl//.... The first witness is the debtor&#39;s father.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Rēmūtu/Bēl-zēru-<em>ibni//&Scaron;amba&#39;</em>; <strong>C</strong> = Ea-nāṣir"
