paraphrase: "Promissory note for beams. Interest at default.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 200 pairs of good-quality split logs (<em>gu&scaron;ūru tāpalu babban&ucirc;</em>) each 1 cubit long (cf. CAD T, 178), to <strong>A</strong>, to be delivered in Arahsamna (VIII) in the house of <strong>C</strong>. He will start paying the usual 20% interest if he fails to meet the deadline. The logs should be dry (<em>ablu</em>) and strong (<em>pitnu</em>). <strong>D</strong> acts as guarantor for the delivery. A short note at the end of the document clarifies that the logs are the ones that had been given (<em>nadānu</em>, G Stat.) to <strong>D</strong>. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: L&acirc;bā&scaron;i/Zēria//Nabāya.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nergal-rēṣūa, slave of Iddin-Marduk; <strong>B</strong> = Marduk-&scaron;umu-iddin/Kiribtu//Bēlāya; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-ibni; <strong>D</strong> = Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu/Rēmūtu&nbsp;"
