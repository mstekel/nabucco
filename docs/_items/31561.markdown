paraphrase: "About dates, temple property and lease-related revenues. The head of the Egibi family is involved.<br /> The beginning of this tablet is broken, but probably refers to dates grown by seven gardeners (<em>nukarribu</em>) and the collection of which is the prerogative (<em>makkūru</em>) of the temple of Bēl. It further mentions a man named <strong>A</strong> and the collection of lease-related revenues (<em>sūtu</em>) that are due to <strong>B</strong>. The tablet is too fragmentary to reproduce a coherent story. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>= Marduk-naṣir-apli <em>&hellip;</em> (=?Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi);&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>= Iddinaya"
