Reference to additional outstanding debts.<br /> <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, his mother, should deliver the full amount (<em>gamru</em>) of 0.3<sup>?</sup>.2 kor of barley that are due from them to <strong>A</strong>, a slave of <strong>D</strong>, in Ayyar (II). Delivery should be in one instalment in the creditor&#39;s house, according to the latter&rsquo;s measure. The two debtors assume warranty for each other. The one who has barley available at the time of delivery should give it. In addition (<em>elat</em>), there is a previous credit claim (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) charged against the same people, and still another credit claim charged against <strong>C</strong>, <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s father.
