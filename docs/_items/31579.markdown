paraphrase: "Receipt for dates.<br /> <strong>A</strong> receives 40 kor (c. 7,200 l) of dates on <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s orders (<em>ina na</em><em>&scaron;parti</em>) from <strong>B1</strong> and <strong>B2</strong>, who were sent (<em>mār &scaron;ipri</em>) by <strong>C</strong>. The dates are part of his father&rsquo;s claim (<em>ra&scaron;ūtu</em>) against <strong>C</strong>. The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each, in order to make sure that this agreement will not be changed. Names of 1 witness and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Marduk-rēmanni/Iddin-Marduk/Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B1</strong> = Tabn&ecirc;a, messenger of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>B2</strong> = Madān-ahu-iddin, messenger of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>C</strong> = Rēmutu/Nab&ucirc;-rēhti-uṣur; <strong>D </strong>= Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n"
