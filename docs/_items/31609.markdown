paraphrase: "Promissory note for barley (and) silver. Fixation of interest.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 12 kor of barley (and) &frac12; minas of medium quality silver, of which one-eighth is alloy to <strong>A</strong>. The barley should be delivered in Ayyār (II) at the canal and the silver debt will bear a 20% interest from Ayyār (II) onwards, to be paid on a monthly basis. In addition, there are three earlier promissory notes for 84 kor of dates and 2 minas of medium quality silver, of which one-eighth is alloy, which <strong>B</strong> still has to pay. He has also still to deliver 5 kor of barley in Kislīm (IX) (i.e., next month), and if he fails to do so, he should pay 50 shekels of white silver instead of the barley. Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Bēl-uballiṭ/Bēl-eṭēru//Ir&rsquo;anni; <strong>B </strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi"
