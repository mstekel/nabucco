paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Pledge of a slave in antichresis.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes [a broken amount] of mina(s) of medium quality silver, of which one-eighth is alloy to <strong>A</strong>. The debt is secured by the pledge of the debtor&rsquo;s slave (<strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>). <strong>A</strong>&#39;s income from the slave&#39;s work pays for the interest (antichresis) and he is exempt from paying rent for the slave. Should the pledged slave flee (lit. &quot;go to another place&quot;), the debtor shall pay 3 q&ucirc; of barley on a daily basis to the creditor as compensatory payment for his loss of income from the absent slave. The debtor should also provide (<em>katāmu</em>, lit. &quot;cover&quot;) for the slave&rsquo;s clothing. Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Ha&scaron;dāya/Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-zēri//Bābūtu; <strong>B </strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong><sup>f</sup>C </strong>= <sup>f</sup>Mu&scaron;ēzibtu, slave of <strong>B</strong>"
