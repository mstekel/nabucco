paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Purchase price. Interest payable on deposit.<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup>A </strong>sold a house from her dowry to <strong>D</strong>, a royal clerk (<em>sepīru &scaron;a &scaron;arri</em>), and 5 minas and 2 shekels of silver of the purchase price had still not been paid to her. The buyer had deposited this amount of silver with <strong>B</strong> who already gave the seller and her son (<strong>C</strong>) part of it, keeping the remainder (1 mina of silver) in deposit. <strong>B</strong> should pay 2/3 minas of silver to the seller and her son as interest on the silver that is still with him. In the past he transferred 1/2 minas [and 2 shekels] and paid interest on 1 1/2 minas 2 shekels till the end of Ṭebēt (X). Cf. BM31151 (= Nrgl 60).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup>A </strong>= <sup>f</sup>Gugūa/Zākiru//I&scaron;inu; <strong>C </strong>= Ea-zēru-ibni/Bēl-zēru-lī&scaron;ir//Egibi, son of <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong>; <strong>B </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>D </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-..., royal clerk (<em>sepīru &scaron;a &scaron;arri</em>)&nbsp;"
