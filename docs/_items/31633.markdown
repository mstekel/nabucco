paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver, barley and dates within the framework of a business partnership (<em>harrānu</em>).<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes x+2 shekels of silver, 5 kor of barley (and) 5 kor of dates to <strong>A</strong>. These are assets that <strong>C</strong> invested in a business partnership (<em>harrānu</em>). The silver and the barley should be delivered without interest in Ayyār (II), while the dates in Ta&scaron;rīt (VII). <strong>D</strong> acts as guarantor for the payment. In addition, there is an earlier promissory note for a broken amount of dates that <strong>B</strong> still has to pay. The payment is secured by the pledge of the debtor&rsquo;s field (<em>zēru) </em>planted with date palms (<em>bīt gi&scaron;immarē</em>) and cultivated with grain (<em>p&icirc; &scaron;ulpu</em>). Witnesses.
