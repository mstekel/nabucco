paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver, within the framework of a business partnership (<em>harrānu</em>). Fragmentary<br /> <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> owe a broken amount of silver (in minas) to <strong>A</strong>, slave of <strong>C</strong>. Possibly, it concerns the purchase price of dates ([<em>&scaron;īm suluppē</em> (?)]), considering the fact that the delivery date is in Ta&scaron;rīt (VII) and delivery is by means of boats at the Borsippa canal. The document further refers to 100 onion strings (<em>gidlu</em>) belonging to <strong>D</strong> that&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>&nbsp;on account of (<em>ana muhhi</em>) .... At this point the text becomes fragmentary. Reference is made to the assets of their business partnership (<em>harrānu</em>) and the business investment (<em>harrānu</em>) of someone whose name is broken off. Cf. BM33133 (= Nbn 466). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: L&acirc;bā&scaron;i/Zēria//Nabāya<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Nergal-rēṣūa, slave of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>B<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Ea-nāṣir/Mu&scaron;allim//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Nanāya; <strong>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Rēmūt-Bēl/Bēl-zēru-ibni//&Scaron;abbā&rsquo;; <strong>C </strong>= Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>D </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-r&ecirc;mu-&scaron;ukun; <strong>E</strong>&nbsp;= [broken off]"
