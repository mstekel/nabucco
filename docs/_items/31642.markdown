paraphrase: "Promissory note for dates. Fragmentary<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong>, slave of Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi, owes 60 kor of dates to <strong>A</strong>, to be delivered on the 20th of Kislīm (IX) at the river in Babylon. She should also pay for the costs of transporting&nbsp; these dates. Payment is in the measure of [PN]. <strong>C</strong> acts as guarantor for the payment. In addition, there is an earlier promissory note, but at this point the document is broken off. The document refers to Hursagkalamma in a broken context, probably in relation with the origin of the dates.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-aplu-iddin/Rēmūtu//Pahāru; <strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Ahunnatu, slave of &Scaron;irku (aka Marduk-nāṣir-apli)//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = &hellip;/&hellip;//Mukallim-<em>x</em>"
