paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver without interest. Pledge of two individuals (slaves?).<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 1 mina and 12 shekels of medium quality silver, of which one-eigth is alloy, to <strong>A</strong>, to be paid without interest in Abu (V) of the next year (lit. &quot;Nabonidus 9th year&quot;). The debt is secured by the pledge of two individuals (<strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> and <strong>D</strong>). No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged person until the debt is fully repaid. A fragmentarily preserved passages seems to refer to the debtor&#39;s legal purchase of the two individuals and antichresis. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Marduk-aplu-uṣur/&Scaron;ākin-&scaron;umi//Adad-&scaron;umu-ēre&scaron;.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Nidintu/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;arru-uṣur; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Alik&scaron;u-lūmur; <strong>D</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Nab&ucirc;."
