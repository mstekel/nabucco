paraphrase: "Promissory note for barley.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 66;3.2.0 (kor) of barley to <strong>A</strong>, to be delivered in their full amount (<em>gamru</em>) in Ayyār (II). Delivery is due on the creditor&#39;s plot of land (<em>bītu</em>) at the Borsippa canal. This barley was given (to <strong>B</strong>) (<em>nadānu</em>, G Stat) to buy seeds and pay for the maintenance of the farmers (<em>ikkaru</em>). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Nergal-uballiṭ/Nab&ucirc;-bān-ahi.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Nergalahu-iddin/Ahhea"
