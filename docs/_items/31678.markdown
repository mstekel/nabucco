paraphrase: "Receipt of an <em>ilku</em>-payment (and)<sup>?</sup> the entire flour-tax by the head of the Egibi family.<br /> <strong>A</strong> receives payment (<em>mahāru</em>) from <strong>B</strong> for the <em>ilku</em>-tax from Nisan (I) till the end of Addar (XII) of Darius&rsquo; 24<sup>th</sup> year that is due from him. The exact amount that is paid is not specified. A short remark at the very end of the obverse, before the witness list, states that <strong>A</strong> (also<sup>?</sup>)* receives payment (<em>mahāru</em>) from <strong>B</strong> for his entire flour-tax (<em>qēmu</em>) for the 24<sup>th</sup> year. The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> *The verb of receipt (<em>mahir</em>) occurs twice: once with <em>ilku &scaron;a</em> <strong>B</strong> (ll. 1-7) and once with <em>qime&scaron;u gammar </em>(ll. 8-10) as direct object. These could be seen as two different taxes or service obligations, or the latter could be a specification of the more general <em>ilku</em>.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=&Scaron;i&scaron;ku/Iddinaya//Egibi<sub> </sub>(=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi);&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=Nab&ucirc;-ittannu/Bēl-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun//Suhaya"
