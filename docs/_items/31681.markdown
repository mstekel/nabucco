paraphrase: "About persons and their enlistment.<br /> The document is badly preserved and poorly understood. It starts by referring to two persons, <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>, together with the registers of their enlistment (<sup>gi&scaron;</sup>&Scaron;ID), but then becomes very fragmentary. The king is mentioned, as well as <strong>B</strong>, Governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>) of Babylon, some additional lists and a kind of professionals or labourers (<sup>l&uacute;</sup>[...]). At the end we should probably read &quot;have received&quot;, thus assuming that <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> received several persons together with the registers about their enlistment. Sirik/Iddinaya (=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu), head of the Egibi family, is among the witnesses. Names of 5 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>=Rēmūtu/Marduk-u&scaron;allim//<em>Pahāru;&nbsp;</em><strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>=Libluṭ/Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu//<em>Sīs&ecirc;;&nbsp;</em><strong>B</strong>=Gūzānu/<em>Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-ukīn</em>//&Scaron;a-nā&scaron;ī&scaron;u;&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>=&hellip; (broken)"
