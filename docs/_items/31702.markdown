paraphrase: "Receipt of silver paid on behalf of the head of the Egibi family. Partial payment of a debt.<br /> <strong>A</strong> receives* 3 minas and 45 shekels of white, medium quality silver, of which 1/8 is alloy from <strong>B</strong>, paid on behalf of (<em>ana muhhi</em>) <strong>C</strong>. This silver is part of (<em>ina</em>) a larger claim (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) that <strong>A</strong> holds against <strong>C</strong>. The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each. The list of witnesses is broken off at the beginning, but is preserved in the duplicate document BM31869 (=Dar 472).<br /> <br /> *Verb of receipt is broken.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=&Scaron;addinnu/Madān-ahhē-iddin//&Scaron;ig&ucirc;a;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=Nidintu/Kabtia//Ir&#39;anni;&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>=&Scaron;irku/Iddinaya//Egibi (=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi)"
