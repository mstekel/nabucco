paraphrase: "Receipt for onions.<br /> Concerns the receipt of the purchase price for onions which <strong>A</strong> sold to <strong>B</strong>.<br /> The beginning of the tablet is badly preserved but refers to a broken amount of onions, a slave, and the xth year of Cyrus. It then continues by stating that 5,000 bundles belong to <strong>D</strong>, thus resulting in a total of 42,000 bundles of onions for the 5th year of Cyrus. <strong>C</strong>, slave of <strong>B</strong>, received them from <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s messenger. In the present document <strong>A</strong> receives the silver for the sale of these 42,000 bundles of onions from the buyer (<strong>B</strong>) and is paid off. This does not include the 48,000 bundles of onions, which a man whose name is broken off* will deliver to <strong>B</strong> in Simān (III) of the xth year of Cyrus. Besides this there exists an earlier claim by <strong>B</strong> (against the same person). Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> *Perhaps again <strong>A</strong> or his messenger?<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Nergal-ahu-iddin; <strong>B </strong>= Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>C </strong>= Madān-bēl-uṣur, slave of <strong>B</strong>; <strong>D </strong>= Nergal-ēṭir"
