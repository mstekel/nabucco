The debt should be paid with the income from his onion field. The (indebted) silver is the amount that has been paid to the temples of Nergal and Nab&ucirc;. In addition, there is a claim (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) by <strong>D</strong> against <strong>B</strong>. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Bēl-ibni/Nergal-zēru-ibni//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Nanāya.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nergal-rēṣūa, slave of Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-zēru-ibni/Ha&scaron;dāya; <strong>C</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>D</strong> = Madān-bēlu-uṣur<br /> &nbsp;"
