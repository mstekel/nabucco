paraphrase: "Promissory note for assessed field rent (<em>imittu</em>), to be delivered in dates.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 60 kor of dates to <strong>A</strong> and his brothers, the assessed field rent (<em>imittu)</em> on land(*) located (at) the New Canal. The dates should be delivered in one instalment according to <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s measure in Arahsamna (VIII). He should also deliver the usual by-products of the date cultivation: for each kor of dates they shall give spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>), fibres (<em>mangagu</em>), [a load] of firewood, (and) 2 <em>dar</em><em>īku</em>-containers. This is followed by a clause the exact meaning of which remains unclear: 3 gur <em>&uacute;-ṣab-bat </em>3 gur <em>a</em><sub>4</sub><sup>?</sup> [x (x)]-<em>nu</em><sup>?</sup>-<em>nu-ri </em><sup>┌</sup><em>i-na</em><sup>?</sup>-<em>ad</em><sup>┐</sup>-[<em>din</em>]. The document concludes by pointing out (twice!) that the gardener&#39;s remuneration (<em>&scaron;issinnu</em>) has been paid (<em>etēru </em>G Stat), but no payment has been received for the services of the agricultural supervisor (<em>gugallu</em>). Witnesses.<br /> (*)<em>im</em>[<em>itti </em>(<em>eqli</em>)].<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= Gimil-&Scaron;ama&scaron;/Lī&scaron;ir//&Scaron;ama&scaron;-bari&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;"
