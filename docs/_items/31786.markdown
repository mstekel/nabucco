They should pay a yearly interest of 20% on a monthly basis. The debtors assume warranty for each other and the one who has silver available at the due date shall pay. All their property in and outside the city are pledged to the creditor. No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged objects until the creditor has received the full repayment of the debt. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe: Marduk-erība/Iqī&scaron;āya//S&icirc;n-karābī-i&scaron;me (<strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>).<br /> <br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = &Scaron;addinnu/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun//Mandidi; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Marduk-erība/Iqī&scaron;āya//S&icirc;n-karābī-i&scaron;me; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = &Scaron;addinnu/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun//Mandidi"
