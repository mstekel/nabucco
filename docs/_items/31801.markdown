paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Pledge of slave.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 1/3 minas of silver to <strong>A</strong>, to be paid in D&ucirc;zu (IV). In addition, there is an earlier claim (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>). The document is mainly concerned with the details pertaining to a female slave (<strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>) whom <strong>B</strong> got as pledge from <strong>D</strong> and then pledged to <strong>A</strong> (<em>ma&scaron;kānu &scaron;akānu</em>).&nbsp; This slave was currently with <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong>, <strong>D</strong>&#39;s sister-in-law (<em>kallatu</em>) and therefore unavailable to <strong>B</strong>&#39;s creditor, so that the latter took the current document (<em>&scaron;aṭāru</em>) as security (<em>ma&scaron;kānu</em>) instead.<br /> Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Ina-Esagil-&scaron;umu-ibni/Dayyān-Marduk//Mu&scaron;ēzib.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Ahu-ittab&scaron;i/Laqipi; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Gudaditu, female slave of &Scaron;umu-iddin/Nergal-zēru-ibni; <strong>D</strong> = &Scaron;umu-iddin/Nergal-zēru-ibni; <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Bu&#39;ītu, wife of Nādinu/&Scaron;umu-iddin and daugther-in-law of <strong>D</strong>"
