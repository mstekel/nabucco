paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver.<br /> <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> owe 9 shekels of medium quality silver of which one-fifth is alloy to <strong>A</strong>, the royal harbor master (<em>rab kāri &scaron;a &scaron;arri</em>), to be paid on the 20<sup>th</sup> of Simān (III).&nbsp; The silver is &quot;of the onion habor&quot; (<em>kāri &scaron;a &scaron;ūmi</em>), meaning that the debt results from an onion transport by boat and the costs related to such transports (cf. BM31097). The two debtors assume warranty for each other. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-lī&scaron;ir/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Nab&ucirc;//Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;eme.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Gimillu/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-zēru-ibni//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu, royal harbor master (<em>rab kāri &scaron;a &scaron;arri</em>); <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Bēl-ahhē-erība/Nab&ucirc;-nāṣir//Pahāru; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Marduk-nāṣir/Bēl-iddin//Re&#39;i-sīs&ecirc;"
