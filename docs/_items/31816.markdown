paraphrase: "Receipt of an <em>ilku</em>-payment (and)<sup>?</sup> the advance payment on the bow-tax by the head of the Egibi family. Impost related to a bridge. Paid on behalf of a third party.<br /> The <em>ilku</em>-tax for &ldquo;the supplement to the bridge&rdquo; (<em>ṭipi &scaron;a gi&scaron;ri</em>)* from D&ucirc;zu (IV) of the 26<sup>th</sup> year of Darius till the end of Simān (III) of the 27<sup>th</sup> year is due from <strong>C</strong>. <strong>A</strong> receives it (<em>mahāru</em>) from <strong>B</strong> for <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s account (<em>ana muhhi</em>). A short remark at the very end of the obverse, before the witness list, states that he (also<sup>?</sup>)** receives (<em>mahāru</em>) an advance payment on the bow-tax (<em>panāt qa&scaron;ti</em>). The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> *<em>ṭipi &scaron;a gi&scaron;ri</em> probably refers to a supplement that had to be paid to the bridge toll (see Jursa 2010, xxx).<br /> **The verb of receipt (<em>mahir</em>) occurs twice: once with <em>ilku &scaron;a</em> <strong>B</strong> (ll. 1-7) and once with <em>pānāt qa&scaron;ti</em> (l. 8) as direct object. These could be seen as two different taxes or service obligations, or the latter could be a specification of the more general <em>ilku</em>.<br /> <br /> <strong>A&nbsp;</strong>= &Scaron;irku/Iddinaya//Egibi (=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi);&nbsp;<strong>B&nbsp;</strong>= Iddinaya/Qī&scaron;tia;&nbsp;<strong>C&nbsp;</strong>= Nab&ucirc;-nādin-ahi/Aplaya"
