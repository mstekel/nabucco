paraphrase: "Renting of a boat to the head of the Egibi family.<br /> <strong>A</strong> rents (<em>ana idi nadānu</em>) a boat to <strong>B</strong> for a broken amount (x minas) of white, medium quality silver, of which 1/8 is alloy, starting in two weeks. The boat is 6 cubīts [wide at its beam]<sup>?</sup> and belongs to <strong>C</strong>, a clerk (<em>sepīru</em>), but was put at <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s disposal (<em>ina pāni</em>)<em> </em>for boat-service duty (<em>malahūtu</em>). A fragmentarily preserved clause relates to the use that may be made of the boat and any possible infringements in this respect: the boat may (or should?) sail to ... (uncl.) the old<sup>?</sup> Canal (<em>ul-te-bal </em>[<em>abālu</em> &Scaron;]), and if <strong>B</strong> ... (uncl.) he will pay x minas to<strong> C</strong>. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>= Kīnaya;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi;&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>= Arad-&Scaron;ama&scaron;<sup>?</sup>, (<em>sepīru&nbsp;</em>of <em>PN</em>)"
