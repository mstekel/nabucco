paraphrase: "Receipt for silver. Related to sheep and a mule.<br /> The text concerns debts that <strong>B</strong> owes to <strong>A</strong>, partly being paid in the present document and partly still outstanding. The first (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) debt concerns 657 sheep which <strong>B</strong> owes to <strong>A: B</strong> receives all the silver (that was promised to him), the earlier and later amounts, from <strong>A </strong>and<strong> D</strong> guaranteed for the delivery of the animals. However, the text record that he still owes silver for a mule and something else that is lost in a badly preserved passage. <strong>A</strong> receives from <strong>B</strong> payment for the interest on the silver of <strong>C</strong> till the end of Intercalary Ulūl (VI2) and the 10 shekels of silver, the capital amount of <strong>C</strong>. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B </strong>= Bēl-iqī&scaron;a/L&acirc;bā&scaron;i; <strong>C </strong>= Iddināya; <strong>D </strong>= Gimil-&Scaron;ama&scaron;"
