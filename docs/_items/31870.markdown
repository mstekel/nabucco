Related to a house sale.<br /> <strong>B</strong><strong><sub>1</sub></strong> and his wife (<strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong>) owe 1 mina and 38 &frac12; shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>, on which they should pay a yearly interest of 20% on a monthly basis starting from the 1<sup>st</sup> of Simān (III) of Nabonidus 5<sup>th</sup> year onwards. The indebted silver is what remains (to be paid to<strong> A</strong> for the loan of 2 minas and 10 shekels that he lent to the couple) for the purchase of <strong>C</strong>&#39;s house. The sale is recorded in BM32871 (= Nbn 85) and the issue of <strong>A</strong>&#39;s loan to the couple recounted in <a href=\"http://nabucco.arts.kuleuven.be/ca_babtekst/index.php/editor/objects/ObjectEditor/Edit/object_id/7362\" target=\"_blank\">BM33945</a> (= Nbn356).
