paraphrase: "Receipt for silver. Payment for a debt by a third person<br /> <sup>f</sup><strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>&nbsp;(her husband) receive the &frac12; mina and 5 shekels of silver that&nbsp;<strong>B&nbsp;</strong>owes to<sup> f</sup><strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>. The silver is paid to them by&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>. &nbsp;<strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong>, a slave who also goes by the name &Scaron;alam-dīninni was pledged (to secure the debt), and should no doubt be returned to the debtor. Note that the creditors had under-pledged this slave for one of their own debts (BM33156 = Nbn 390). Further note that four days later, <strong>B </strong>sells <sup>f</sup><strong>D,&nbsp;</strong>his slave (together with two other slaves), to Iddn-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;aya/Nūr-S&icirc;n who sends C, his son-in-law to pay to the seller: BM30810 (= Nbn 392) records B&#39;s receipt of the purchase price.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <sup>f</sup><strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>&nbsp;= <sup>f</sup>Bunanītu/Na&rsquo;id-Marduk/Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc;;&nbsp;<strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>&nbsp;= Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-zēri/Ina-tē&scaron;&ecirc;-ēṭir//Ēṭiru (husband of <sup>f</sup><strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>);&nbsp;<strong>B&nbsp;</strong>= Nabu-tultab&scaron;i-lī&scaron;ir/Bēl-zēru-ibni/Nappāhu;&nbsp;<strong>C&nbsp;</strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <sup>f</sup><strong>D</strong>&nbsp;= <sup>f</sup>Ṭābatu (aka: &Scaron;alam-dīninni), a slave"
