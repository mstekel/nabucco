paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver without interest. Pledge of land.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 12 shekels of stamped (?) silver (<em>ginnu</em>), of which one-eighth is alloy to <strong>A</strong>, to be paid without interest (<em>qaqqadu</em>) in D&ucirc;zu (IV). The payment is secured by the pledge of the debtor&rsquo;s arable land, located next to the creditor&rsquo;s arable land, until the creditor has received the full repayment. The silver is the purchase price (<em>&scaron;īmu</em>) for dates that were harvested in Darius&rsquo; 10<sup>th</sup> year (on the debtor&#39;s land) (<em>kaspu &scaron;īm suluppē ebūr eqli &scaron;a &scaron;anat 10</em>). Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-mu&scaron;ētiq-udd&ecirc;/&Scaron;āpik-zēri//Nādin-&scaron;e&#39;im"
