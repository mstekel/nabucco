paraphrase: "Promissory note for assessed field rent (<em>imittu</em>), to be delivered in dates. Fragmentary.<br /> <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>owe 21 kor of dates <strong>A</strong> and his brothers, the assessed field rent on land (<em>imitti eqli</em>) located at the branch (<em>bābu</em>) of the old Kutha-canal. They should deliver the dates in one instalment at the canal. Delivery is due in in Arahsamna (VIII). They should also deliver the usual by-products of the date cultivation: for each kor of dates they shall give (the customary amount of) spathes (<em>tuhallu</em>), spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>), (and) fibres (<em>mangagu</em>), and one load of firewood. They will (also) pay for the <em>hab&ucirc; uhinni</em>-tax (and give) 2 <em>darīku</em>-baskets. A fragmentarily preserved <em>elat</em>-clause seems to refer to additional debts that are still pending. The document ends with a short but badly preserved passage about &quot;2 kor for (ripening in) the oven&quot; (<em>tinūru</em>). Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>A<sub>2 </sub></strong>= brother of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>B<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Aplāya/Iqī&scaron;a; <strong>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Nab&ucirc;-uṣur&scaron;u/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl"
