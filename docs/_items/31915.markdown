paraphrase: "Promissory note for assessed field rent (<em>imittu</em>), to be delivered in dates. Fragmentary<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes a broken amount of dates to <strong>A</strong>. This is most likely assessed field rent ([<em>imitti eqli</em>]), but the pertinent passage at the beginning of the tablet is broken off, including the details on the land for which this rent is being paid. <strong>B</strong> should deliver the dates to the courtyard (<em>haṣāru</em>) in one instalment according to the 36 liters measure. Delivery is due in Arahsamna (VIII). He should also deliver the usual by-products (<em>itt&ucirc;</em>) of the date cultivation: a load of firewood, [spathes] (<em>tuhallu</em>), 50 spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>), [fibres] (<em>mangagu</em>), (and) 1 <em>darīku</em>-container. The document ends with a prohibiton to prune (<em>arū</em> D) any live part of the date palm (<em>raṭbu</em>). Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= Bēl-iddin/[PN]//Pahāru&nbsp;"
