paraphrase: "Promissory note for assessed field rent (<em>imittu</em>), to be delivered in dates. Very fragmentary.<br /> The first part of the document is broken off, but no doubt contained the names of the parties involved, the amount of dates that was to be paid as field rent and a description of the land from which they were to come. The text becomes legible at the point where the terms of delivery are discussed. The dates are due in Ta&scaron;rīt (VII) and should be delivered [&hellip; at] the Kutha-canal together with the usual by-products of the date cultivation: for each kor of dates he shall give spathes (<em>tuhallu</em>), a load of firewood, spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>), fibres (<em>mangagu</em>), offshoots (<em>liblibbu</em>), (and) 2 <em>darīku</em>-containers. The document ends by stating that &quot;he should deliver (them) on the 20<sup>th</sup> of [name of month broken off]&quot;. This may relate to the delivery of the dates, the by-products or both. Witnesses."
