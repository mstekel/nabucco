paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Pledge of a slave.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 1 mina of silver to one of his sisters (<strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong>), to be paid in &Scaron;abāṭ (XI). The debt is secured by the pledge of the debtor&#39;s slave (<strong>C</strong>). No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged slave until the debt is fully repaid. The document specifies the origin of this silver, namely, it is silver from the creditor&#39;s dowry. It is not clear whether this is silver from the patrimonium that the brother still had to give to his sister as (part of) her dowry, or silver from her dowry that she had borrowed to him? Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Bēl-u&scaron;allim/Zēria//Nabāya.<br /> <br /> <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Zunnāya/Zēria//Nabāya; <strong>B</strong> = Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl/Zēria//Nabāya; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;ēzib, slave of Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl/Zēria//Nabāya"
