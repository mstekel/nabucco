paraphrase: "Pledge of a house for a silver debt.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 2 minas of silver to <strong>A</strong>. The payment is secured by the pledge of the debtor&#39;s house located at the procession-road called &quot;thoroughfare of Nergal-of-Joy&quot; (<em>mūtaq Nergal &scaron;a had&ecirc;</em>). No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged house until the creditor has received the full repayment. The (indebted) silver was paid to <strong>C</strong> (<strong>A</strong>&#39;s brother-in-law) and <strong>D</strong>. Names of 5 witnesses and the scribe: Marduk-erība/Iqī&scaron;āya//S&icirc;n-karābi-i&scaron;me.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Nādinu/Arad-Gula//Lultammar-Adad; <strong>C</strong> = L&acirc;bā&scaron;i (=Bēl-u&scaron;allim)/Zēria//Nabāya; <strong>D</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;āpik-zēri/Balāssu//A&scaron;pe"
