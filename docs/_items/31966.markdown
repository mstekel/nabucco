paraphrase: "Receipt of dates and barley by the head of the Egibi family. Partial repayment of a debt. Fragmentary.<br /> The beginning of the document is broken. When the text becomes legible we hear about debts that were contracted to the debit of <strong>B</strong> (<em>ina muhhi ~ e&rsquo;elu</em>). He owes 245.3.0 kor of dates and 8.1.2 kor of barley to <strong>A</strong> and 1/3 mina of silver to <strong>C</strong>, <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s slave. The current document records <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s receipt (<em>mahāru</em>) of part of this debt (<em>ina libbi</em>)* from <strong>B</strong>. The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each. Names of 3 witnesses. The remainder of the list of witnesses and the name of the scribe are broken off.<br /> <br /> *Namely 58 kor<em> </em>of [...], x+1 kor of barley [...], and x x.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=Nab&ucirc;-māku-uṣur/Nab&ucirc;-aplu-<em>iddin.&nbsp;</em><strong>C</strong>=Madān-bēlu-uṣur, slave of <strong>A</strong>"
