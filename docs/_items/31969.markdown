paraphrase: "Security for a silver debt. Due from the head of the Egibi family and his brother. Pledge of land and mutual surety.<br /> Two brothers (<strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>) owe 16 2/3 minas and 4 shekels of white silver, of which 1/8 is alloy [&hellip;] to <strong>A</strong>. The debt bears a yearly interest of 20% to be paid on a monthly basis. Payment is secured by the pledge of real estate and the fact that each one of the debtors assumes warranty for the other. The one who has silver available at the time of repayment should give it to cover the capital amount (<em>qaqqadu</em>) and its interest (<em>hubullu</em>). Pledged are: (1) the debtors&#39; orchard (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>) on the road to Ki&scaron; next to <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and next to <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>. (2) their acreage (<em>zēru</em>) in Bīt-Hahhuru next to <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> and next to <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong>. No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged objects until <strong>A</strong> has received full repayment of the capital amount and the interest.
