paraphrase: "Establishment of a business partnership. Head of the Egibi family is the investor.<br /> The present record, formulated as a standard promissory note, documents a business partnership agreement. <strong>A</strong> invested 51 kor of dates, income from the collection of tithes (<em>e&scaron;ru</em>) for the temple of Bēl, in a business partnership (<em>harrānu</em>) with <strong>B</strong>. The latter owes him the dates (<em>&scaron;a</em> <strong>A</strong><em> ina muhhi </em><strong>B</strong>). The partners agree that they will share equally (<em>ahi zittu akālu</em>) in the profits (<em>utru</em>)<em> </em>that <strong>B</strong> makes (<em>epē&scaron;u</em>) of the dates in or out of town. <strong>B</strong> assumes warranty for the capital amount of the dates. The partnership is to last three years. Names of 7 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=&Scaron;ama&scaron;-ina-tē&scaron;&ecirc;-ēṭir/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-iddin//&Scaron;ama&scaron;-abārī"
