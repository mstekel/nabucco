paraphrase: "Promissory note to deliver dates (<em>imittu</em>-lease) from land at the Rab-kāṣir Canal to the head of the Egibi family. One third is due to the Treasurer.<br /> <strong>B</strong> should deliver 60 kor of <em>imittu-</em>dates that are due from him to <strong>A </strong>and his brothers in Arahsamna (VIII) according to his creditor&#39;s measure, in one instalment at the courtyard (<em>haṣāru</em>). 1/3 of it is the share of <strong>C</strong>, the Treasurer (<em>ganzabaru</em>). The dates are due from the harvest of a field located at the Rab-kāṣir Canal.<br /> <strong>B</strong> should also deliver the usual by-products of the date cultivation: for each kor he shall give a load of spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>), spathes (<em>tuhallu</em>) and fibres (<em>mangagu</em>), the offshoot(s) (<em>liblibbu</em>), and 2 <em>darīku</em>-containers. The <em>sissinnu</em>-payment has not been paid (<em>eṭēru</em>); and not even one cubīt of the stretch of the dam (<em>mu&scaron;annītu</em>) (assigned to him for work) has been removed (<em>nishu nasāhu</em>) (partly uncl.)
