paraphrase: "Receipt of silver. Settlement of accounts in Ayyār (II) of Nabonidus&lsquo; 15th year.<br /> Concerns a total of 5 1/2 minas of silver (not included the interest on it) that are at <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s disposal. This sum consists of 4 minas of silver, (income) from Simān (III) of the previous year, and 1 1/2 minas of silver, (income) from Ta&scaron;rīt (VII) of the same year that <strong>B</strong> took from (<em>na&scaron;</em><em>&ucirc;</em>) the outstanding assets (<em>s</em><em>ūqu</em>). Out of these 5 1/2 minas of silver <strong>A</strong> receives 59 shekels from <strong>B</strong> and therewith they have settled their accounts. In addition, <strong>B </strong>disposes over a promissory note for silver that is due to <strong>A</strong> and is dated in Kislīm (IX) of the previous year. He also disposes over the compensatory payment that was paid when he and his wife (<strong>fC</strong>) were absent last year in Ṭebēt (X) and thus caused a loss of income to his master (<strong>A</strong>).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-uterri, slave of <strong>A</strong>; f<strong>C </strong>= fMiṣatu, wife of B"
