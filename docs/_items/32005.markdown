paraphrase: "Receipt for silver. Purchase price for a donkey.<br /> Concerns a donkey but any further qualifications are lost in the badly preserved passage at the beginning of the document. <strong>A</strong> sold it for its full price, 1/3 minas and 5 shekels of medium-quality silver of which 1/8 is alloy to <strong>B</strong>. In the present document, <strong>A</strong> receives the full amount of silver, the purchase price for the donkey, from <strong>B</strong>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Rēmūtu/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-ahu-iddin; <strong>B </strong>= Nidintu-Bēl/Marduk-nāṣir-apli//Egibi"
