paraphrase: "Promissory note for dates, silver and onions. Payment for a debt. Pledge renewal.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 105 kor of dates, 1/3 mina and 1 shekel of silver, (and) 42 bundles of onions to <strong>A</strong>. The dates should be delivered in one instalment according to the creditor&rsquo;s measure in Ta&scaron;rīt (VII). The silver and the onions should be delivered in full (<em>&scaron;alāmu </em>G) in Addar (XII) from the income of his onion field (<em>&scaron;ikittu</em>)(*) The payment is secured by the pledge of land (<em>eqlāti</em>) which had already been given to the creditor (= pledge renewal). In addition, there are earlier promissory notes owed by <strong>B</strong> that are still pending. No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledge land until <strong>A</strong> has received the full repayment of his debt. Witnesses.<br /> (*)CF.
