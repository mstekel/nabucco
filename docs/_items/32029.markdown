paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Pledge of a house. Fixation of interest at default.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 1 mina and 54 shekels of unstamped (?) (<em>la ginnu</em>), medium quality silver, of which one-eighth is alloy to <strong>A</strong>, to be paid without interest (<em>qaqqadu) </em>in Simān (III). The payment is secured by the pledge of his house located on the Hubur-street, next to the house of <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s sons. If the debtor fails to meet the deadline, he will apparently start paying interest on the debt starting from the 1<sup>st</sup> of D&ucirc;zu (IV), but the pertinent passage is badly preserved. Witnesses.<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-balāssu-iqbi/Bēl-iddin//Damqa; <strong>B </strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>C </strong>= Nergal-zēru-ibni"
