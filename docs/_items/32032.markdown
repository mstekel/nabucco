paraphrase: "Promissory note for revenue from impost on the harvest, to be delivered in dates.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 13.2.3 kor of dates to <strong>A</strong>. It is <strong>A</strong>&#39;s share (<em>zittu</em>) in the impost on the harvest (<em>imitti ebūri</em>) from land (<em>eqlu</em>) located opposite (<em>muhhi</em>) the branch (<em>bābu</em>) of the old Kutha-canal. He should deliver the dates in one instalment according to <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s measure. Delivery is due in Arahsamna (VIII). He should also deliver the usual by-products of the date cultivation: for each kor of dates he shall give (the customary amount of) spathes (<em>tuhallu</em>), spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>), offshoots (<em>liblibbu</em>), (and) fibres (<em>mangagu</em>), one load of firewood and 2 <em>darīku</em>-containers. <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> have not yet settled between them the accounts for the 15<sup>th</sup> year (<em>epu&scaron; nikkassi qat&ucirc;</em>). <strong>B</strong> still needs to pay for the <em>hab&ucirc; uhinni</em>-tax and the <em>&scaron;ugarr&ucirc;</em>-supplement as stipulated in the promissory note (<em>aki </em><em>u&#39;ilti</em>) of last year (lit: of the 15<sup>th</sup> year).
