It is what remains (<em>rīhtu</em>) of the promissory notes of <strong>B</strong> which (are) in Pudanu under <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s jurisdiction (<em>&scaron;a qātē</em>) (partly uncl.). In addition, there is an earlier promissory note for the 17<sup>th</sup> year. They have settled their accounts (<em>epē&scaron; nikkassi qat&ucirc;</em>). Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Bunene-ibni; <strong>B </strong>= Bunene-ibni/&Scaron;idiru(wr.<em>&scaron;i-di-ru</em>)-lūmur; <strong>C </strong>= Marduk/Bēl-īpu&scaron;//Mu&scaron;ēzib"
