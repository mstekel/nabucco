paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Without interest. General pledge and third party guarantor.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 12 minas of silver to <strong>A</strong>, mayor domo (<em>rab bīti</em>) of the crownprince, to be paid without interest (<em>qaqqadu</em>) in Nisan (I). The payment is secured by the pledge of the debtor&rsquo;s entire property in and outside the city. No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged property until <strong>A</strong> has received the full repayment of his debt. <strong>C</strong> acts as guarantor for the payment. Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-Ṣābit-qāti, mayor domo (<em>rab bīti</em>) of the crownprince; <strong>B </strong>= &Scaron;umu-ukīn/Mu&scaron;allim-ilu; <strong>C </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi"
