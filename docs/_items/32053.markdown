paraphrase: "Promissory note for assessed field rent (<em>imittu</em>), to be delivered in dates. Fragmentary.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 33 kor of dates to <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong>. Ṭhis is most likely assessed field rent ([<em>imitti </em>eqli]), but the pertinent passage at the beginning of the tablet is broken off, including the details on the land for which this rent is being paid. <strong>B</strong> should deliver the dates in one payment according to the 36 liters measure in the courtyard (<em>haṣāru</em>). Delivery is due in Arahsamna (VIII). He should also deliver the usual by-products of the date cultivation: for each kor of dates he shall give (the customary amounts of) spathes (<em>tuhallu</em>), spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>), and fibres (<em>mangagu</em>), a load of firewood and 2 <em>darīku</em>- and <em>qappatu-</em>containers. Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Eri&scaron;tu/&Scaron;irku//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= Madān-iddin/Ubār"
