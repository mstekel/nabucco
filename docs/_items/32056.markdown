paraphrase: "Promissory note for assessed field rent (<em>imittu</em>), to be delivered in dates.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 34 kor of dates to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>, his brothers and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>. It is the assessed field rent on land (<em>imittu</em> [<em>eqli</em>]) located at the branch (<em>bābu</em>) of the old Kutha-canal and includes (<em>ina libbi</em>) the 25 kor of dates from the 2 sectors located next to the S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu family land. The passage regarding the terms of delivery is badly preserved. We can learn from it that <strong>B</strong> should deliver the dates at the old Kutha-canal together with the usual by-products of the date cultivation: for each kor of dates he shall give [spathes (<em>tuhallu</em>)], a load of firewood, [spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;)], </em>fibres <em>(mangagu</em>), offshoots (<em>liblibbu</em>) [&hellip;]. No payment has been received (<em>eṭēru</em> G Stat) for the gardener&#39;s remuneration (<em>&scaron;issinnu</em>). In addition, there is another claim (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu) </em>between the same parties that is still pending. Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>A<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu/Marduk-bān-zeri//Bēl-eṭēru; <strong>B </strong>= Ninurta-ahu-iddin/&hellip;"
