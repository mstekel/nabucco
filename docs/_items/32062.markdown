paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver without interest. Pledge of slave.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 2 minas and 7 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>, to be delivered on the 10<sup>th</sup> of Ṭebēt (X), without interest. The payment is secured by the pledge of the debtor&#39;s slave (<strong>D</strong>). No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged slave until the creditor has received the full repayment. <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> act as guarantors for the payment, assume warranty for each other, and the one among them who has silver available at the time of repayment will pay. The present document was drawn up in the presence of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>&#39;s wife (<strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong>). Witnesses. A short remark at the end of the document clarifies that the silver, to which <strong>F</strong> is entitled, has been spent for Nab&ucirc;-dīnu-epu&scaron;.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Sūqāya/Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir-nap&scaron;āti//Bābūtu; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahu/Tabnēa//Ah-bāni; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = L&acirc;bā&scaron;i/Zēria//Nabāya;&nbsp;<strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun/Tabnēa//Ah-bāni; <strong>D</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-dīnu-epu&scaron;, slave of <strong>B</strong>; <strong><sup>f</sup>E</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Gula-qa&rsquo;&rsquo;i&scaron;at, wife of <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>F</strong> = Kalbāya"
