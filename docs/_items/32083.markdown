paraphrase: "Promissory note for onions and barley.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 8400 strings (<em>gidlu</em>) of onions and 5;0.0.0 (kor) of barley to <strong>A</strong>, to be delivered without interest in Ayyār (II) in &Scaron;ahrinu. Should he fail to do so, he shall deliver the whole amount of onions and barley in Babylon (<em>gamāru </em>D<em>-ma nadānu</em>). In addition, there is an earlier promissory note between the same parties (that is still pending). However, claims (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) by <strong>C</strong> against <strong>B</strong> about assets that <strong>A</strong> invested in the business partnership (<em>harrānu</em>) have been annulled (<em>hep&ucirc;</em>). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Nab&ucirc;-kīnu-iddin/&Scaron;ad&ucirc;nu//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Gula.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-zēru-u&scaron;ab&scaron;i/Marduk//Damqa; <strong>B</strong> = Mukīn-zēri/Nergal-epu&scaron;//Ea-eppe&scaron;-ilī; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-nādin-apli"
