paraphrase: "About onions, income from the impost on land. Share of the Treasurer.<br /> The document probably records the receipt of 70 bundles of onions although the verb of receipt is not preserved. The onions are the income from the <em>&scaron;ib&scaron;u</em>-impost on land (<em>&scaron;ib&scaron;i eqli</em>). It is the 1/3 share (<em>zittu &scaron;al&scaron;u</em>) of <strong>C</strong>, the Chief Treasurer (<em>rab kāṣiri</em>), and was received by one of his slaves (<strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>), who actually acted as proxy (<em>na&scaron;partu</em>) for another of his slaves (<strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>), from <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>=Bēl-ēṭir, slave of <strong>C;&nbsp;A<sub>2</sub></strong>=...-ia, slave of <strong>C</strong>;<strong>&nbsp;B<sub>1</sub></strong>=<em>...&scaron;arru</em>-uṣur;&nbsp;<strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>=Talīmu.../Hāziru;&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>=Bagasarū, (<em>rab kāṣiri</em>)"
