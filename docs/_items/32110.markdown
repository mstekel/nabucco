paraphrase: "Receipt of silver from the head of the Egibi family. Probably purchase price of a slave.<br /> <strong>A</strong> receives (<em>mahāru</em>)* 1/2 mina of medium quality silver of which 1/8 is alloy from <strong>B</strong>. Paid on behalf of (<em>ana muhhi</em>) <strong>C</strong>. This transfer of silver is also mentioned in Abraham2004001; analogous transfers are mentioned in MnB1870. It is probably linked to the sale document BM30927 in which <strong>B</strong> buys a slave from <strong>C</strong> and his brothers. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> *l. 7 end: &lt;<em>ma-hir</em>&gt;.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-ukīn/Bēl-ēṭir//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Nanāya;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi;&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>=Bēl-nādin-apli/Bēl-uballiṭ//Pahāru"
