paraphrase: "Receipt for silver. Purchase price. Payment to sellers&rsquo; creditor.<br /> <strong>fA1</strong>, <strong>A2</strong> and <strong>A3</strong> sold their slave (<strong>D</strong>) to <strong>B</strong> for 1 m 10 shekels of silver, their exact price (<em>&scaron;īm harī</em><em>ṣ</em>). They receive only part of the purchase price because the other part is used to pay off one of their debts. Accordingly, <strong>C</strong>, the creditor, receives (<em>mah</em><em>ā</em><em>ru</em>) a broken amount of shekels in payment for his claim (<em>kum ra&scaron;</em><em>&ucirc;tu</em>) against the sellers. <strong>A2</strong> and <strong>A3</strong> <em>receive</em> (<em>mah</em><em>ā</em><em>ru</em>) x+9 shekels; and <strong>fA1</strong> and &hellip;. [broken off] receive (<em>eṭ</em><em>ē</em><em>ru</em>) the rest of the purchase price (amount is broken) from &nbsp;the buyer.
