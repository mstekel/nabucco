paraphrase: "Settlement of debts and update of the bookkeeping.<br /> The document deals with the settlement of still outstanding debts and the complicated book-keeping that it creates. It concerns dates which the fathers of <strong>B<sub>1</sub> </strong>and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> owed to the fathers of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>. Their sons discuss the terms of repayment, and <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> agree to deliver (<em>nadānu</em>) the still outstanding amount of 25;2.0 kor of dates in Arahsamna (VIII). They should deliver it to<strong> A<sub>1,</sub></strong>&nbsp;and his brothers on the one hand, and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> and his brother on the other hand. With respect to what has already been paid (<em>eṭēru</em>) in the past: <strong>D </strong>should show proof of it to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> so that they can remove it (<em>nasāhu</em>) from their balance-sheet. With respect to the estimated income in dates from impost of the previous year: it was estimated at 100 kor based on the rate of 5 kor of dates per kor of land, and this amount has been (delivered and hence) deducted (<em>&scaron;umqutu epē&scaron;u</em>) from the balance-sheet. Should it now turn out that the exact amount of impost exceeds 100 kor (<em>alla atāru)</em>, <strong>B<sub>1 </sub></strong>and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> must deliver the difference to <strong>A<sub>1 </sub></strong>and<strong> A<sub>2</sub></strong> together with (<em>itti</em>) the pertinent documentation (<em>u&rsquo;iltu-&scaron;u</em>). However, should it turn out that the impost is less than 100 kor (<em>alla m&acirc;ṭu)</em>, they can deduct (<em>nasāhu</em>) what they paid too much from (<em>ina</em>) their (abovementioned) still outstanding debt <em>(u&rsquo;iltu-&scaron;unu</em>) to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong><sub> &nbsp;</sub>and<strong> A<sub>2</sub></strong><sub>. </sub>The final matter that needs to be arranged in this context is the payment of a remuneration for the gardeners (<em>&scaron;isinnu</em>). It should be done in accordance with what can be read (<em>amāru</em>) in <strong>C<sub>1 </sub></strong>and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>&rsquo;s document (<em>u&rsquo;iltu) </em>about the income from last year&rsquo;s impost: in case the gardener&rsquo;s remuneration has not been settled (<em>eṭēru</em>), they (who?) should &ldquo;read&rdquo; (<em>amāru) </em>12 kor (of dates) as payment for the gardeners and pay (<em>nadānu</em>) it to him (who?) &ndash; partly uncl. This whole arrangement does not include what remains to be paid by <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>&rsquo;s father to <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>&rsquo;s father. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>A<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Erība-Marduk/Bānūnu//Rab-ban&ecirc;; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = &Scaron;umu-ukīn/Etellu; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Mardukāya/Kalbāya//Arad-Ea; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = Bān&ucirc;nu, father of <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi, father of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>D</strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc; (without affiliation)"
