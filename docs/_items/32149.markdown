paraphrase: "Promissory note for assessed field rent (<em>imittu</em>), to be delivered in dates.<br /> <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, sons of <strong>C</strong> owe 33 kor of dates to <strong>A</strong>, assessed field rent (<em>imitti eqli)</em>. The document does not say which field is at stake. The dates should be delivered in one payment to the courtyard (<em>haṣāru</em>), together with the usual by-products of the date cultivation: for each kor of dates they shall give (the customary amounts of) spathes (<em>tuhallu</em>), fibres (<em>mangagu</em>), (and) spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>), and a load of firewood, (and) 2 <em>darīku</em>-containers. Delivery is due in Arahsamna (VIII). The two debtors assume warranty for each other. There is still another (<em>elat</em>) claim against them that is still pending (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu mahrītu). </em>The document ends by stipulating that the debtors should cultivate the entire land (<em>zēru epē&scaron;u</em>) and in exchange (-<em>ma</em>), the creditor will deduct (<em>nasāhu</em>) the remuneration for their work (<em>&scaron;</em><em>issinnu</em>) from his claim. Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Madānu-ēre&scaron;, son of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Nab&ucirc;-iddin, son of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>C </strong>= Gimillu"
