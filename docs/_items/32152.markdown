paraphrase: "Promissory note for dates. Payment for a debt. Pledge renewal.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 17.2.3.0 kor of dates to <strong>A</strong>, to be delivered in full in one instalment in D&ucirc;zu (IV) of Cambyses&rsquo; 8<sup>th</sup> year in the creditor&rsquo;s house. The payment is secured by the pledge of the debtor&rsquo;s fields at Bit-ṭabi-Bēl and (his slave) <strong>C</strong>. No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged objects until <strong>A</strong> has received the full repayment of his debt. A fragmentarily preserved <em>elat</em>-clause refers to a claim (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) against [PN and (?)] <strong>D</strong> which <strong>B</strong> has apparently paid off (?) towards the end of Cambyses&#39; 7<sup>th</sup> year. Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir-nap&scaron;āti/Ibnāya; <strong>C </strong>= &Scaron;illimu, (slave of <strong>B</strong>?); <strong>D </strong>= Saparri-ibni"
