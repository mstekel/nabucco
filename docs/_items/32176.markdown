paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Payment for a debt. Pledge of slaves and family members<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 59 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>. The payment is secured by the pledge of three of the debtor&rsquo;s slaves: <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong>, her 13-years old daughter, and her unnamed 6-months old son. The document mentions that <strong>B</strong> bought these slaves from <strong>D</strong>. There follows a badly preserved passage which seems to imply that the seller ordered the buyer to pay the purchase price to one of his creditors (i.c., <strong>A</strong>), and that this should happen in two payments (one of 55 shekels and one of 4 shekels) before the end of Abu (V) (i.e., next month). Should <strong>B</strong> fail to meet the deadline and <strong>A</strong>&#39;s claim is not secured by the pledged slaves, he should pay <strong>A</strong> the full 59 shekels of silver.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Nergal-&scaron;umu-uṣur/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-iddin//Dābibi; <strong>B </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>C<sub>1 </sub></strong>= <sup>f</sup>Habaṣīrtu; <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>C<sub>2 </sub></strong>= <sup>f</sup>Bānitutaddin; <strong>D </strong>= Bēl-iddin/Silīm-Bēl//Damqa"
