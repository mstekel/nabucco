paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. With antichretic pledge of a slave and guarantor.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes &frac12; minas of silver to <strong>A</strong>, to be paid in D&ucirc;zu (IV). The payment is secured by the pledge of the debtor&rsquo;s slave (<strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>), a laundress (<em>pūṣa&#39;ītu</em>). <strong>A</strong>&#39;s income from the slave&#39;s (laundry) work pays for the interest (antichresis) and he is exempt from paying rent for the slave. Once <strong>B</strong> has paid off his debt he is allowed to take back his slave. Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ēre&scaron;/Tabnēa//Ahu-bāni; <strong><sup>f</sup>C </strong>= <sup>f</sup>&Scaron;almu-dīninni, slave of <strong>B</strong>"
