paraphrase: "Promissory note for assessed field rent (<em>imittu</em>), to be delivered in dates.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes a broken amount kor of dates to <strong>A</strong> and his brothers. This is most likely assessed field rent [<em>imitti eqli</em>]), but the pertinent passage at the beginning of the tablet is broken off. The rent is paid for land located [&hellip; at] the road to Ki&scaron; and shared (<em>pūt zitti</em>) by <strong>A</strong> and his brothers. The dates should be delivered in one payment according to the 36 liters measure to the courtyard. Delivery is due in Arahsamna (VIII).<strong> B</strong> should also deliver the usual by-products of the date cultivation: for each kor of dates he shall give a load of spathes (<em>tuhallu</em>), spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>), fibres (<em>mangagu</em>), (and) 2 <em>darīku</em>-containers with a 0;0.3 kor capacity. The document ends with the to prune (<em>arū</em> D) any live part of the date palm (<em>raṭbu</em>). Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= Gūzānu/Mār-bīti-iddin//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Nanāya"
