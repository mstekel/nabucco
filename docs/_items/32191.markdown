It is the assessed revenue (<em>imittu</em>) (from land) at the branch (<em>bābu</em>) of the old Kutha-canal, including the x+14 kor of dates from 2 sectors &hellip; [at this point the document is broken off]. The passage The passage regarding the terms of delivery is badly preserved. We can learn from it that <strong>B</strong> should deliver the usual by-products of the date cultivation, a.o. fibres (<em>mangagu</em>), and 2 <em>darīku</em>-containers. No payment has been received (<em>eṭēru</em> G Stat) for the gardener&#39;s remuneration (<em>&scaron;issinnu</em>). In addition, there is another claim (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu) </em>against <strong>B</strong> that is still pending. Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>A<sub>2 </sub></strong>= brother of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>B </strong>= [the name is broken off]; <strong>C </strong>= Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu/Marduk-bān-zeri"
