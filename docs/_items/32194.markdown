paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver without interest.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 10 minas of silver to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>, to be paid without interest in Nisan (I) to the creditor and his mother (<strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>2</sub></strong>) and in the presence of <strong>C</strong>, governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>) of Babylon. A fragmentarily preserved clause describes the silver as part of a larger sum of 25 1/2 minas of silver that apparently belonged to <strong>D </strong>and had been given to <strong>B</strong>.<br /> <br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-mukīn-zēri/Ina-tē&scaron;&ecirc;-ēṭir//&Scaron;ama&scaron;-abārī; <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = Tabluṭa, mother of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>B</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Marduk-zākir, governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>) of Babylon; <strong>D</strong> = Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu"
