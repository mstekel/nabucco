paraphrase: "Promissory note for dates.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes a broken amount of dates to <strong>A</strong>, to be delivered in Arahsamna (VIII) at the courtyard (<em>haṣāru</em>) in one instalment and measured according to the 36 liters measure. <strong>B</strong> should also deliver the usual by-products of the date cultivation: for each kor he shall give a load of spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>), spathes (<em>tuhallu</em>), fibres (<em>mangagu</em>) and offshoot(s) (<em>liblibbu</em>). Witnesses.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>&Beta;</strong> = Bēl-epu&scaron;/Nādinu//Uballissu-Marduk"
