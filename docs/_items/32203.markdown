paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver with interest. Sale of dowry property. Deposit of purchase price. Fragmentary.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 1 mina and 10 shekels of silver to <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong>. The creditor took silver that she got from selling some of her dowry property, and lent it to <strong>B</strong> without her son (<strong>C</strong>) being present, although he and his brothers owned a half share in their mother&#39;s dowry. The debtor pledges his house worth 1/2 mina and 5 shekels of silver. There is interest to be paid, namely 5 shekels on a yearly basis. At this point the text is badly preserved, mentioning <strong>D</strong> and promissory notes that have been deposited with him: &quot;once <strong>C</strong> has paid the 1 mina and 10 shekels of silver to? <strong>D</strong> [on behalf of?] <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong>. ... [broken off]. This no doubt refers back to BM30304 (= Nbn 44) when <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> and her son receive interest on the silver that they received from the sale of a house from her dowry and is deposited with <strong>D</strong>. Witnesses.<br /> <br /> <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Gugūa/Zākiru//I&scaron;innu; <strong>B</strong> = Tabnēa/Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;allim//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu; <strong>C</strong> = Ea-zēru-ibni/Bēl-zēru-lī&scaron;ir//Egibi, son of <strong><sup>f</sup>A</strong>; <strong>D</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi"
