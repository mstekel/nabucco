paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver, wool and vessel with butter.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 2 minas of silver, 1 talent of wool and a 0;0.3 kor-container of butter to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>, who decided to transfer his claim and the pertinent promissory notes to <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>. The new creditor should collect the silver from <strong>B</strong> and then settle the barley debt that <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> still owes to him. He shall give any exceeding silver (<em>utru</em>) to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> without delay. <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> undertakes to pay off his debt to <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> should the latter fail to collect the silver. Witnesses.<br /> <br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = Rēmūtu/ Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun/; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir/ Amurru-nāṣir"
