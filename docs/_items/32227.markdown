paraphrase: "Renting of a boat and receipt of the rent money. Rented to the head of the Egibi family.<br /> <strong>A</strong> rents (<em>ana idī&scaron;u nadānu</em>) a boat to <strong>B</strong> and receives (<em>mahāru</em>-<em>eṭēru</em>) 1/3 mina of white, medium quality silver as rent money (<em>idū</em>) and (<em>adi</em>) for the boat&rsquo;s maintenance (<em>kurummatu</em>). The boat belongs to <strong>C</strong>, Canal Inspector (<em>ma&scaron;ennu</em>), but is at <strong>A</strong>, boatman&rsquo;s disposal (<em>ina pāni, mallāhu</em>)<em> </em>for boat-service duty (<em>mallāhūtu</em>). The boat will sail to Bi&scaron;tu-&scaron;a-ṣēru&rsquo;a, but should not pass (<em>etēqu</em>) the fortified settlement (<em>birtu</em>); if the boat passes it, the renter shall pay an additional 5 minas of silver. He has to dismantle (<em>napālu</em>)* the boat upon arrival at its destination. The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> *The verb refers to ship breaking (rather than to unloading), a process that allowed re-use of ship parts or easier transport upstream over land.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=Nab&ucirc;-zēru-<em>iqī&scaron;anni</em>/Erē&scaron;u;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=&Scaron;irik/Iddinaya//Egibi (=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi);&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>=Balāṭu/Ina-qibi-<em><sup>d</sup>...</em>, (<em>ma&scaron;ennu</em>)"
