paraphrase: "Letter concerning soldiers and troops. The Governor of Babylon complains to the head of the Egibi family about his unloyal handling of their recruitment.<br /> <strong>A</strong> (who has no title but may be identified with the Governor of Babylon) accuses <strong>B</strong> of having lied to him (<em>pirṣāti dabābu</em>) by telling him that <strong>C</strong>, the charioteer (<em>mār sīs&ecirc;</em>), and <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s auxiliary charioteer troops (<em>ta&scaron;lī&scaron;u</em>) are enlisted (<em>&scaron;aṭāru</em>) with <strong>B</strong>. If so, they should have been ready available. However, the Commander of the Citadel (<em>rab dūri</em>) came to <strong>A</strong> and withheld (<em>kal&ucirc;</em>) <strong>C</strong> and all the charioteers from doing <em>reserve(?)</em> service (<em>kutallu</em>) for <strong>A</strong>. They have been taken away (<em>abāku</em>). <strong>B</strong> should have defended <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s interests before the Commander (<em>p&icirc; &scaron;akānu</em>) but instead made common cause with him and transferred <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s (military) resources to himself (<em>nikkassu na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>). After the accusations follow the instructions. <strong>A</strong> orders <strong>B</strong> to write a letter to the town of Danipinu in the Sealand concerning <strong>C</strong>, who has in the meantime been appointed at the head of a fleet, and is apparently moving his troops to the south. The letter should contain the following message: The charioteers, auxiliary troops and citizen-soldiers (<em>mār bān&ecirc;</em>) should not be released (<em>mu&scaron;&scaron;uru</em>) to <strong>C</strong> and he should be stopped from raising improper claims (<em>pirṣātu dabābu</em>) against my soldiers (<em>ṣābū</em>) with the Commander of the Fortress. <strong>B</strong> should talk to <strong>D</strong> and muster (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) other soldiers instead of the soldiers which the Commander withheld. The soldiers of the <em>gardu</em>-workers about whom <strong>A</strong> instructed <strong>B</strong> (<em>ṭēmu &scaron;akānu</em>), should be allowed to go (<em>paṭāru </em>D). <strong>B</strong> will have at his disposal (<em>ina pāni</em>) the guards (<em>maṣṣāru</em>) at the gates and all the charioteers as well as the troops from Bīt-Dakkuru who are stationed (<em>wa&scaron;ābu</em>) in Babylon, so that he should not interfere with the troops of <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s chariot-property (<em>bīt narkabti</em>). The burden (<em>baganu</em>) of the King lies on (<em>ina muhh&iacute;</em>) <strong>B</strong>.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=Gūzānu/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-ukīn//&Scaron;a-nā&scaron;ī&scaron;u;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=&Scaron;irku (=?Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi);&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>=Libluṭ, (<em>mār sīs&ecirc;</em>); <strong>D</strong>=Atkal-ana mār-Esagil/S&icirc;n-bēlu-uṣur, (<em>&scaron;a rē&scaron; &scaron;arri</em>)"
