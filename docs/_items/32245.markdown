paraphrase: "Receipt of silver from the head of the Egibi family. Payment of salary.<br /> <strong>A</strong> receives (<em>mahāru</em>) 1/3 minas of marked silver from <strong>B</strong>. The background to this payment is a labour agreement between both parties according to which <strong>A</strong> will work for <strong>B</strong> (<em>ina pāni PN uzuzzu</em>) at a yearly salary (<em>idū</em>)<em> </em>of 1/3 minas of marked silver, starting on the 1<sup>st</sup> of &Scaron;abaṭ (XI). Accordingly, the silver that <strong>A </strong>receives in the current document corresponds to a one-year salary. The document is dated on the 20<sup>th</sup> of Ṭebet (X). Whether the recorded payment is an advance payment for a full year (Peiser, BRL 3, 46) or a delayed one after almost a year of work (Abraham 2004), is a matter of interpretation. The kind of work is not specified, unlike BM30787 where the same person receives 8 shekels of silver a month for sailing a boat to Babylon. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=Bulṭaya/Habaṣīru//Rē&#39;i-alpi;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi"
