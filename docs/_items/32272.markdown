paraphrase: "Receipt for silver and barley<br /> <strong>A</strong> receives silver and barley from <strong>B</strong>, which were due from him. The amounts are badly preserved: [x]+2/3 minas of silver of which 1/8 is alloy, [x]+ 5 kor (c. 900 l) of barley. Interest is mentioned but the pertinent passage, and the entire tablet in general, are badly preserved.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Nargia/...; <strong>B </strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi"
