paraphrase: "Receipt for silver. Partial payment of a debt and promise to pay remainder.<br /> <strong>C</strong> has a claim against <strong>B</strong> for 50 shekels of silver, the repayment of which is secured by an antichretic pledge of a house. The house is rented out to <strong>A</strong>, who eventually took over <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s claim, probably after having paid him the amount of silver that <strong>B</strong> owed him. He received the original debt note from <strong>C</strong>. In the present document, the debtor pays a part of his debt, namely 1/2 mina and 7 shekels of silver, to <strong>A</strong> and promises to pay the rest by Ṭēbet (X). Witnesses<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Marduk-ēṭir/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun//&Scaron;umu-lib&scaron;i; <strong>B </strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>C </strong>= Itti-Nab&ucirc;-balāṭu/&Scaron;umu-ukīn//&Scaron;ig&ucirc;a"
