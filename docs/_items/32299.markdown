paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Fixation of interest. Pledge of land.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 7 minas of unstamped (?) (<em>la ginnu</em>), medium quality silver, of which one-eighth is alloy, to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and his brother (<strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>), to be paid in Addar (XII) of the 19<sup>th</sup> year. The debt bears a 20% interest, to be paid on a monthly basis, and is secured by the pledge of a plot of land measuring 3 kor and planted with date-palms which is located at the I&scaron;tar-canal in Bit-Nab&ucirc;-bēl-ilī next to <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s plot of land. If the debtor fails to meet the deadline and the debt is still not paid in Nisan (I), the creditor is entitled to [6]0 kor of dates from the pledged palm grove on a yearly basis. Whatever is harvested in excess to these 60 kor of dates belongs to <strong>B</strong>. If the harvest turns out to be less than 60 kor, the debtor should (still) deliver the rest (apparently, from other date palm groves in his possession). Each year shall <strong>B</strong> deliver dates and pay interest to his creditors (passage partly broken). At the end of the document it is pointed out&shy;&shy;&shy; that the indebted silver is the rest of an earlier promissory note for 220 kor of dates owed by <strong>B</strong> to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>. Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>A<sub>2 </sub></strong>= brother of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>B </strong>= &Scaron;ellebi/Pallil-uballiṭ; <strong>C </strong>= Rēmūt/Sūqāya//Egibi"
