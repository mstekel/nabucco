paraphrase: "Promissory note for barley. Business assets.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes a broken amount of barley to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>. Part of it (6 kor) is what the latter two men invested in a business partnership (harrānu) with <strong>B</strong>, and another part (12 kor) is the share? ... (at this point the document breaks off). The 6 kor of barley should be delivered in Simān (III) in Babylon [broken off]. In addition (<em>elat</em>), there are previous debts (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) that <strong>B</strong> has not yet paid off. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Marduk-&scaron;āpik-zēri/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-iddin//Nādin-&scaron;e&rsquo;i.<br /> <br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = Libluṭ/Nergal-u&scaron;allim/Ile&rsquo;&rsquo;i-Marduk; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-ukīn/&hellip;//Rab-ban&ecirc;"
