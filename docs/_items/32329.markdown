paraphrase: "Promissory note for barley.<br /> <strong>B</strong>, slave of <strong>C</strong>, owes 27 kor of barley to his master&#39;s son (<strong>A</strong>), to be delivered in Ayyār (II) of Darius&#39; 26th year in Ālu-&scaron;a-Bēl. Delivery is in one instalment and according to the 36 liters measure. Should he fail to deliver the barley, he shall provide 4 barrels of good quality beer for the winter. Background to the barley debt is a deal that <strong>B</strong> concluded in Darius&#39; 24th year and according to which he acquired rights in the use of a cow (<em>zitti alpi</em>) against the payment of part of the barley that he was to harvest in the next year (Darius&#39; 25th year) with the cow&#39;s help. A short note at the very end of the document, after the date, refers to 3;3.3 kor of dates from <strong>B</strong> for <strong>A</strong>. Witnesses.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nidintu-Bēl/Marduk-nāṣir-apli//Egibi; <strong>B</strong> = Madān-iddin, slave of Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Egibi; <strong>C</strong> = Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Egibi"
