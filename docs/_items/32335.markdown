paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver with antichretic pledge of house.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 4 minas of silver to <strong>A</strong>. The debtor&#39;s house located next to <strong>C</strong>&#39;s house and <strong>D</strong>&#39;s house, is pledged to the creditor, who enjoys the right of usufruct in lieu of interest (antichresis). The house is actually rented out to <strong>E</strong> for 7 years. The creditor will pay 3 out of the 4 minas of silver to PN (to whom the house is pledged), and the remaining 1 mina to two other creditors of <strong>B</strong> (<strong>F</strong> and <strong>G</strong>). A short remark at the end of the document relates to additional payments: The debtor should <em>pay</em>(?) for 2 <em>kīnayātu </em>together with the creditor (<em>amāru</em>, lit. &quot;to see&quot;). Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe: Marduk-zēru-ibni/Nab&ucirc;-mu&scaron;ētiq-udd&ecirc;//...<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Madān-&scaron;umu-iddin/Zēria//Nabāya; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun/Marduk-nādin-&scaron;umi//Sipp&ecirc;(a); <strong>C</strong> = Etellu/Nab&ucirc;-uballiṭ//Gallābu; <strong>D</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-balāssu-iqbi; <strong>E</strong> = Nergal-iddin; <strong>F</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya;<br /> <strong>G</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-zēru-u&scaron;ab&scaron;i/Kalbāya"
