paraphrase: "Promissory note for dates, emmer wheat and silver. Interest and receipt of interest.<br /> <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>&nbsp; owe 6.4 kor of dates, 3.3 kor of emmer wheat and 10 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>. The dates should be delivered at the next date harvest, in Arahsamna (VIII). The emmer wheat should be delivered in Simān (III) (i.e. next month). There exist a document (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) about this silver debt that provides that the debt bears interest (<em>hubullu rab&ucirc;</em>) and the debtors should remove earth clods (<em>pa&scaron;ka na&scaron;&ucirc;). </em>Each one of the debtors assumes warranty for the other. In addition, there is a lease contract for gardening work (<em>nukaribbutu</em>). A short note at the end of the document states that the creditor already received (<em>mahāru</em>) 2 shekels of silver, part of the interest on the 10 shekels of silver. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe: Bēl-iddin/Nab&ucirc;*-mukīn-zēri//Balāṭu.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Madān-ēre&scaron;/Gimillu; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-iddin/Gimillu"
