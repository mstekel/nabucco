paraphrase: "Promissory note for dates and barley. Transfer to a new creditor. Fragmentary.<br /> The promissory note (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) for 180 kor of dates and 106 kor of barley that has been contracted to the credit of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>, a courtier (<em>rē&scaron; &scaron;arri</em>) serving in &Scaron;ahrinu, now belongs to <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>. <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s brother is mentioned in a badly preserved passage, followed by a big gap in the tablet. When the text picks up again, it states that any promissory note that is credited to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and turns up in his brother&rsquo;s house belongs to the new creditor. Names of 4 witnesses and the scribe: Aplāya/Mu&scaron;allim-Marduk.<br /> <br /> <strong>A<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>A<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Bēl-ahhē-iddin/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk//..., a courtier (<em>rē&scaron; &scaron;arri</em>) in &Scaron;ahrinu; <strong>C </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-balāssu-iqbi/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk//..., brother of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>"
