Expenditures.<br /> The document lists various quantities of silver that were expended a.o. to buy jars (<em>dannu</em>) by <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> (66 1/2 shekels), to buy beer from Borsippa (16 shekels), to pay for house rent (<em>idū</em>) (55 shekels), and to extend loans (<em>ina pāni</em>)<em> </em>against interest (<em>hubullu</em>) (15 shekels; 20<sup>? </sup>shekels to <strong>C</strong>; and a broken amount to <strong>D</strong>). It also lists expenditures of 100 kor of dates which are at the gate of Babylon. Missing dates (<em>maṭ&ucirc;</em>) (unless this refers back to the 100 kor of dates at the gate); and 14 kor of dates from Dilbat. The end of the tablet is badly preserved.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>= Napu&scaron;tu;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>= Dayyān-Marduk;&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>= Kabtia/Mu&scaron;allim-Marduk; <strong>D</strong>= Bēl-<em>qa&hellip;</em>"
