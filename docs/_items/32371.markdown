paraphrase: "Receipt of silver by the head of the Egibi family. Partial repayment of a debt. Reference to the sale of a prebend by the debtors.<br /> <strong>A</strong> receives* 1 2/3 minas of medium quality silver, of which 1/8 is alloy, from <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, his son. It is part of a larger debt (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>)<em> </em>of 4 minas of medium quality silver, of which 1/8 is alloy, 66 kor of dates, and 4<em> </em>kor<em> </em>of some other kind of produce, that <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> owes to <strong>A</strong>. His orchard (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>) in Ṣilimma had been pledged (<em>ma&scaron;kānu ṣabātu</em>) to secure the repayment of the dates (<em>kūm</em>). A badly preserved clause at the end refers to the sale of a prebend (<em>&scaron;īm isqi</em>) by the debtors and its interpretation is open to discussion. Names of 5 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> *Verb of receipt is broken.<br /> **ll. 8-12: &quot;About the 1 2/3 minas silver, the price of the prebend of the [...] which<sup>? </sup><strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong>A</strong> with <sup>m</sup>[...].&rdquo;<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi;&nbsp;<strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>=Bēl-upahhir/Nergal-iddin;&nbsp;<strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>=Bēl-ibni(or -nāṣir)"
