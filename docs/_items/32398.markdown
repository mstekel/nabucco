paraphrase: "Receipt of silver for house rental<br /> <strong>A</strong>, slave of <strong>C</strong>, receives two payments from <strong>B</strong> on his master&rsquo;s behalf. One payment of 8 shekels of silver for rent of <strong>C&rsquo;</strong>s house in the first half of the (current) year; the second payment, which amounts to 4 shekels of silver, was charged by <strong>C</strong> to the debtor (for unspecified reasons). A cryptic note at the end of the document clarifies that the silver is what remained to be paid as house rental, but it is a matter of interpretation whether this relates to both sums or only to the first one. Names of 2 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Nergal-rēṣuā, slave of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>B </strong>= Arad-Bēl/Kalbāya//Mu&scaron;allim; <strong>C </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi"
