paraphrase: "Promissory note for assessed field rent (<em>imittu</em>), to be delivered in dates.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 35 kor of dates to <strong>A</strong>, the assessed field rent (<em>imitti eqli</em>) on land located at the Zabunu-ditch, to be delivered in one instalment to the courtyard. Delivery is due in Arahsamna (VIII). He should also deliver the usual by-products of the date cultivation:&nbsp; for each kor of dates he shall give (the customary amounts of) spathes (<em>tuhallu</em>), fibres (<em>mangagu</em>), (and) spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>) from green dates (<em>uhinnu</em>), a load of firewood, and 2 <em>dar</em><em>īku</em>-container. In addition, there is a promissory note (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) but at this point the document is badly preserved. It is followed by a statement concerning the settlement of accounts (<em>epu&scaron; nikkassi</em>) of the 9<sup>th</sup>(?) year [&hellip;], and <strong>B</strong>&#39;s obligation to pay for the <em>hab&ucirc; uhinnu-</em>tax. Finally, it is said that his gardener&#39;s remuneration (<em>&scaron;issinnu</em>) has not been entirely paid (<em>&scaron;alāmu </em>G). Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= Lī&scaron;ir/Nab&ucirc;-bān-ahi//S&icirc;n-&scaron;ad&ucirc;nu"
