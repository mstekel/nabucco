paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver and barley. Payment for a debt. Without interest. Pledge of land.<br /> Two brothers (<strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>) owe 12 shekels of silver and 6.3.2.0 kor of barley to <strong>A</strong>, slave of <strong>C</strong>. The silver should be paid without interest in Nisan (I) of the 8<sup>th</sup> year (i.e., by the end of the month). They should deliver the full amount of barley in one instalment according to <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s measure in Ayyār (II) in <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s house. The brothers assume warranty for each other and the one who has silver and/or dates available at the time of delivery should pay. The payment is secured by the pledge of a grain field (<em>zēru p&icirc; &scaron;ulpu</em>). No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged land until <strong>A</strong> has received the full repayment of his debt. At the very end of the document a short remark points out that the debt results from a payment made (probably by <strong>C</strong> on the brothers&#39; behalf) to <strong>D </strong>(BA <em>&scaron;a ana</em> D <em>&scaron;ūbulu</em>), the royal soldier (<em>ṣāb &scaron;arri</em>). Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Madānu-bēlu-uṣur, slave of <strong>C</strong>; <strong>C </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>1 </sub></strong>= Iddinunu/dammiq; <strong>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Nab&ucirc;-nāṣir/Nab&ucirc;-udammiq; <strong>D </strong>= Mu&scaron;ēzib-Nab&ucirc;, <em>ṣāb &scaron;arri</em>"
