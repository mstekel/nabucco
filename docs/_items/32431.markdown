Delivery is due in Arahsamna (VIII). <strong>B</strong> should also deliver the usual by-products of the date cultivation: for each kor of dates he shall give spathes (<em>tuhallu</em>), spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>), fibres (<em>mangagu</em>), a load of firewood (and) 2 <em>darīku</em>-containers.
