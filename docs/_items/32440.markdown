paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver. Interest at default.<br /> It is about 46 1/24 shekels of silver, the purchase price (<em>&scaron;īmu</em>) for <strong>C</strong>, whom <strong>B<sub>1&nbsp; </sub></strong>took from <strong>A</strong> (<em>ina qātē abāku</em>) and which he still needs to pay. From this sum (<em>ina libbi</em>) he currently pays 5 shekels. The remainder, namely 41 1/24 shekels of silver, should be paid by <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> in D&ucirc;zu (IV) in Babylon to <strong>A</strong>. If <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> fails to meet the deadline, he should do something the details of which are mostly lost in a badly preserved passage: it mentions 4(?) shekels of silver which/for <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> [broken off]. When the text picks up again, it is provided that he (=<strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>) should bring (<em>abāku</em>-<em>ma</em> <em>nadānu</em>) the man he purchased (<strong>C</strong>) and another person (<strong>D</strong>) to Babylon. Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin/&Scaron;ulāya//Egibi; <strong>B<sub>1 </sub></strong>= &hellip;-ba-a; <strong>B<sub>2 </sub></strong>= Nab&ucirc;-zēru-iddin/Iddina//[...]; <strong>C </strong>= Arrabi; <strong>D </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-&hellip;"
