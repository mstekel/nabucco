paraphrase: "Promissory note for assessed field rent (<em>imittu</em>), to be delivered in dates.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes a broken amount kor of dates to <strong>A</strong> and his brothers, the assessed field rent (<em>imitti eqli</em>)(*) on land the location of which is only partly preserved. It appears to be land held in common ownership with <strong>C</strong>. The dates should be delivered to the courtyard (<em>haṣāru</em>) in one payment. Delivery is due in Arahsamna (VIII). <strong>B</strong> should also deliver the usual by-products of the date cultivation: for each kor of dates he shall give spathes (<em>tuhallu</em>), a load of firewood, spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>) from green dates (<em>&scaron;a uhinnu</em>), fibres (<em>mangagu</em>), (and) 1 <em>dar</em><em>īku</em>-container. The document concludes by mentioning 1 <em>qappatu</em>-container, apparently as a late addition to the previous list of by-products. Witnesses.<br /> (*)[<em>imitti eqli</em>].<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= Bēl-talīmu/Nab&ucirc;-silīm; <strong>C </strong>= Bēlet-ēre&scaron;/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-uballiṭ"
