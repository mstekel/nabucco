paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver with antichretic pledge of slave. Fragmentary.<br /> The upper half of the tablet is broken off. A broken amount of silver should be delivered in Ṭebēt (X) and its payment is secured by the pledge of the debtors&#39; female slave (<strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>). No other creditor shall exercise any rights over her until <strong>A</strong> has received the full repayment of his silver, namely 30 shekels. The income from the slave&#39;s work pays for the interest (antichresis). Should the pledged slave go to another place, the debtors shall pay 0;0.3 kor barley on a daily basis to <strong>A</strong> as compensatory payment (<em>mandattu</em>) for his loss of income from the absent slave. The (indebted) silver is what has been paid for the <em>rikis qabli </em>that ... [broken off]. The names of witnesses and of the scribe are broken off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Arad-Bēl/...; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = &hellip;//Balāssu; <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> = <sup>f</sup>Kalbatu, slave of <strong>B</strong>"
