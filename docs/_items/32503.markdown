paraphrase: "Summons to settle debts with the head of the Egibi family.<br /> By the 10<sup>th</sup> of Ṭebēt (X) of the 26<sup>th</sup> year of Darius, shall <strong>B</strong> come to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> (<em>ana pāni</em> PN <em>alāku</em>) in Babylon in order to reach an agreement with him (<em>itti </em>PN<em> dabābu</em>)<em> </em>with regard to his debts (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>). He owes him 1 mina of white, medium quality silver, of which 1/8 is alloy, 3 kor of dates, and cattle<sup>?</sup>. He also owes silver, barley, dates and cattle to one of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>&#39;s slaves (<strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>). For those debts there exist written agreements (<em>&scaron;aṭāru</em>) which <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> concluded with <strong>B</strong> (<em>itti PN</em> <em>&scaron;aṭāru</em>)<em> </em>since Darius&#39; 20<sup>th</sup> year. If <strong>B</strong> does not meet the deadline, he has to pay off (<em>eṭēru</em>)<em> </em>his creditors in agreement with what is provided for (<em>aki</em>) in the promissory notes (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) for silver, barley, dates and cattle. After that date (<em>adannu</em>) he cannot present to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> (<em>ana PN &scaron;akānu</em>) anything about what he might have paid off. Names of 6 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi;&nbsp;<strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>=Madān-bēlu-uṣur, slave of <strong>A</strong><sub><strong>1</strong>;&nbsp;</sub><strong>B</strong>=Bēl-upahhir/Nergal-iddin"
