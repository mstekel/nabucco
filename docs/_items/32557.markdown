paraphrase: "Promissory note for assessed field rent (<em>imittu</em>), to be delivered in dates.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 8 kor of dates to <strong>A</strong>, assessed field rent on land (<em>imitt</em><em>i</em> <em>eqli</em>) &ndash; probably followed by a description of the field&#39;s location but the tablet is broken at this point. <strong>B</strong> should deliver the dates to the courtyard in one instalment together with the usual by-products of the date cultivation: for each kor of dates they shall give (the customary amounts of) spathes (<em>tuhallu</em>), fibres (<em>mangagu</em>), (and) spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>), a load of firewood, (and) 2 <em>darīku</em>-containers. Delivery is due in Ta&scaron;rīt (VII). &nbsp;He should also pay for the <em>hab&ucirc; uhinni-</em>tax. He has not received (<em>eṭēru</em>) any remuneration for his gardening work (<em>&scaron;issinnu</em>). The document ends by referring to the share (<em>zittu</em>) of <strong>C</strong>, which is left out of consideration (<em>elat</em>) in the current promissory note. Witnesses<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Itti-Marduk-balāṭu/Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= Nergal-iddin/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-ahu-iddin; <strong>C </strong>= Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl"
