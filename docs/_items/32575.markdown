paraphrase: "Promissory note for assessed field rent (<em>imittu</em>), to be delivered in dates.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes a broken amount of dates to <strong>A</strong> and his brothers, which is most likely the assessed field rent but the pertinent passage at the beginning of the document is broken off. The full amount (<em>gamru</em>) of dates should be delivered in one instalment according to <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s measure in &Scaron;uppātu. Delivery is due in Ta&scaron;rīt (VII). He should also deliver the usual by-products of the date cultivation: for each kor of dates he shall give (the customary amount of) spathes (<em>tuhallu</em>), a load of firewood, spadices (<em>gip&ucirc;</em>) from green dates (<em>uhinnu</em>), (and) fibres (<em>mangag</em>u) and 2 <em>darīku</em>-containers. Payment for the garderner&#39;s remuneration (<em>&scaron;issinnu</em>) is included in the above (<em>ina libbi</em>). Witnesses.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A </strong>= Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi; <strong>B </strong>= Nab&ucirc;-nāṣir/Nādin//Bābūtu"
