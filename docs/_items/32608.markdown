paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver?. Fragmentary.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes a broken amount of what seems to be silver to <strong>A</strong>, to be paid without interest in ... [the name of the month is broken]. A short note at the end points out that previous claims have been annulled. Names of one witness and the scribe: Bēl-iddin/Ina-tē&scaron;&ecirc;-ēṭir//Nabāya.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-iddin/Ina-tē&scaron;&ecirc;-ēṭir//Nabāya"
