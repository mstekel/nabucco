The debtors&#39; upper field (<em>eqlu elēnu</em>), next to <strong>C</strong>&#39;s plot of land and his lower field (<em>eqlu &scaron;upālu</em>), planted with date palms (<em>bīt gi&scaron;immarē</em>) and grain (<em>p&icirc; &scaron;ulpi</em>), next to the border of the <em>abarakku</em>&#39;s plot of land were pledged to the creditor and remain pledged. No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged land until the debt and its interest are fully repaid. Payment will be in dates and for that purpose the harvest will be assessed (<em>emēdu</em>) in Ta&scaron;rīt (VII) when the dates are still on the trees. The interest is fixed at c. 20% (lit. 0;1 kor per shekel) according to the market value of &Scaron;ahrinu. The (indebted) silver is what has been paid for <em>rikis qabli </em>of the royal soldiers (<em>ṣāb &scaron;arri</em>).
