paraphrase: "Promissory note for silver without interest. Pledge of family members.<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes 1 mina and 5 shekels of silver to <strong>A</strong>, to be paid without interest in D&ucirc;zu (IV). The payment is secured by the pledge of the debtor&#39;s two daughters (<strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong>), whom he bought for 2 minas of silver from <strong>D</strong> in the presence of the seller&#39;s father (<strong>E</strong>) who acted as witness. No other creditor shall exercise any rights over the pledged persons until the debt is fully repaid. In addition, there is an earlier promissory note for 120;0.0.0 kor of dates and 1 mina of silver on which interest is to be paid. Names of one witness and the scribe: Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl (debtor).<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = <sup>f</sup>Quda&scaron;u, daugther of Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl; <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub> </strong>= <sup>f</sup>Bunanitu, daugther of Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Bēl; <strong>D</strong> = Bānia/Nab&ucirc;-ile&rsquo;&rsquo;i//Sagdidi; <strong>E</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ile&rsquo;&rsquo;i"
