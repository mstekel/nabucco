paraphrase: "Promissory note for dates<br /> <strong>B</strong> owes a broken amount of dates to <strong>A</strong>, to be delivered in their full amount (<em>gamru</em>) and in one payment in Arahsamna (VIII) at the Borsippa canal. The debtor is prevented from giving anything to someone else without the creditor&#39;s consent (<em>&scaron;a lā</em>). Names of 4 witnesses but the scribe&#39;s name is broken off.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Iddin-Marduk/Iqī&scaron;āya//Nūr-S&icirc;n; <strong>B</strong> = Tayyālu/Rahiannu"
