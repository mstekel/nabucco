paraphrase: "Settlement of a silver debt through the sale of land and slaves to the creditor. Due from the head of the Egibi family. A previous house sale became void after the house had been seized by the Esagil temple.<br /> <strong>B</strong> sold (<em>ana kaspi nadānu</em>) a plot of land including the house built on it (<em>qan&ucirc; bīt ep&scaron;u</em>) in Babylon&rsquo;s &Scaron;u&rsquo;anna-quarter to <strong>A</strong>, for 1 talent 4 minas and 14 shekels of silver, but later gave the house to the Esagil temple in order to settle one of his debts (<em>apālu</em> N). Consequently, <strong>A</strong> needs to be paid back the silver that he paid for the land and house. In the present document <strong>A</strong> receives (<em>mahāru</em>) 50 minas and 4 2/3 shekels of silver in capital and interest out of the total debt (<em>u&#39;iltu</em>) of more than 1 talent. It is the value in silver of a plot of land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>) of 2 kor, land under cultivation (<em>eqlu merē&scaron;u</em>) of 4.3.2 kor and 10 slaves (<em>amīlūtu</em>) which <strong>B</strong> gave (= sold) to <strong>A</strong>. The parties to the contract have taken one copy of the document each. Names of 21 witnesses and the scribe. Sealed by the seller.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=Anu-mukīn-apli/Anu-ahu-iddin//Ea-q&acirc;lu-i&scaron;emme;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi"
