paraphrase: "Receipt of silver from the head of the Egibi family. Payment for <em>rikis qabli</em>.<br /> <strong>A</strong>, by order of (<em>ina qibi</em>) <strong>C</strong>, receives payment (<em>mahāru</em>) from <strong>B</strong> for his <em>rikis qabli</em> duty. The amount, 1/3 mina and 5 shekels of medium quality silver, of which 1/8 is alloy, is paid for serving in the King&#39;s army (<em>ana alāki ana pāni &scaron;arri</em>), which means that <strong>A</strong> will serve instead of <strong>B</strong>. The sum is in addition to (<em>elat</em>) the previously paid 3 minas of medium quality silver, of which 1/8 is alloy. Names of 3 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=Bēl-iddin/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Ah-bani;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi;&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>=Mura&scaron;&ucirc;/Marduk-&scaron;umu-iddin//Ilu-tillatī"
