paraphrase: "Summons to transmit crops from the land of the Treasurer, and to arrange for their proper registration.<br /> Concerns 170 kor of barley, 4 kor of wheat, and 4 kor of cress (<em>sahl&ucirc;</em>), the harvest (<em>ebūru</em>) of the 11<sup>th</sup> year from the Treasurer&#39;s field (<em>eqlu &scaron;a </em>E <em>ganzabaru</em>).<br /> <strong>A</strong> is held accountable for the proper registration of these products in his (boss&#39;) accounts, but something went wrong and the Treasurer&#39;s mayordomo (<strong>B</strong>) did not receive proof of registration. <strong>A</strong> shifts the blame to the two men whom <strong>B</strong> sent to him together with the products (<strong>C<sub>1 </sub></strong>and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>). The story is recounted in the present document as follows. It opens with <strong>A</strong>&#39;s declaration (<em>qab&ucirc; umma</em>) that the Treasurer&#39;s mayordomo wanted the products to be registered in his accounts (<em>ina muhhi-ya u&scaron;uzzu</em>) saying that he gave them to <strong>C<sub>1 </sub></strong>and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>: they received from him the 170 kor of barley (<em>in-da-har-in-ni</em> [<em>mahāru</em>]), whereas only <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> (<em>ana elat ana </em>PN) was given the 4 kor of wheat and 4 kor of cress (<em>at-ta-din</em> [<em>nadānu</em>]). This is confirmed (<em>kan&ucirc;</em> D) by the two men in their own testimony (<em>eli ramāni-&scaron;unu</em>)<em> </em>as follows (<em>umma</em>): they both took (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) the barley from <strong>B</strong>, and only <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> received (<em>mahāru</em>) the wheat and cress from <strong>B</strong>. The document then stipulates that by the 20<sup>th</sup> of Ayyar (II) <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> should transmit<sup>?</sup>* the barley they received from <strong>B</strong> before <strong>A</strong> and give proof of it to <strong>B</strong> (<em>dagālu </em>&Scaron;<em>-nadānu</em>). Similarly, <strong>C<sub>2</sub> </strong>shall register the wheat and cress he received from <strong>B</strong> in <strong>A</strong>&#39;s account(**)&nbsp;and give proof of it to <strong>B</strong> (<em>u&scaron;uzzu-nadānu</em>). <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> assumes warranty for <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>. <strong>D<sub>2</sub> </strong>assumes warranty for <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>. Names of 11 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> *L. 13: <em>&uacute;-&scaron;&aacute;-</em><sup>┌</sup><em>ad</em><sup>┐</sup>-[<em>gil-ma</em>]; (**)&nbsp;<em>ina muhhi A&nbsp;</em>for usual&nbsp;<em>itti.</em><br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong>=Nidintu, (<em>rab bīti</em>) of Iqī&scaron;a;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>=Erībaya/&Scaron;a-Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;ū, (<em>rab bīti</em>) of <strong>E</strong>;&nbsp;<strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>=Arad-Bāba/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk//A&scaron;lāku;&nbsp;<strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>=&Scaron;ellibu/Iddin-Nab&ucirc;;&nbsp;<strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong>=Marduk-nāṣir-apli/Itti-Marduk-balāṭu//Egibi;&nbsp;<strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong>=&Scaron;ulum-Bābili/Bēl-ahu-iddin;&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>=Bagasarū, (<em>ganzabaru</em>)"
