description: "Here they are, the first 2727 texts, with their metadata and almost all fully paraphrased. They originate from several major private archives from the long sixth century (620-480 BCE), including the Egibi archive from Babylon, three Borsippean archives (<a href=\"http://heron-net.be/nabucco/items/show/22945\">Ea-ilūta-bāni, Ilī-bāni, Nanāhu</a>), and one Sipparean (<a href=\"http://heron-net.be/nabucco/items/show/22837\">Ṣahit-ginê</a>), as well as much of the early Neo-Babylonian material (721-626 BCE). You find a more detailed description of the current coverage as well as information on how the website works, under <a href=\"http://nabucco.arts.kuleuven.be/nabucco/about-the-project\">ABOUT</a>."
