The temple enterer&rsquo;s prebend includes <em>&scaron;ugarr&ucirc;</em>-dates, a lamb, and some other broken items; cattle, sheep, birds for the regular offerings and the royal offering and the meat remains of the sacrificial altar are listed for the other prebendary duties. Standard clauses concerning the receiving of the full price of silver and against further litigation on the part of the seller&rsquo;s party and kin on pain of paying the price twelvefold end the operative section. At least 9 witnesses, scribe lost.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Zēria/Bēl-ibni//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-ahu-u&scaron;ab&scaron;i/...-ēṭir//Saggilāya"
