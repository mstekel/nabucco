paraphrase: "Settlement of prebendary services: <strong>A</strong>, at the behest of <strong>B</strong>, performed monthly 4 days of the baker&rsquo;s prebend in the Ebabbar from Simān (III) until Ta&scaron;rīt (VII) of Darius 19<sup>th</sup> year . He received in payment monthly <em>uppuntu</em>-flour, firewood and (the material for) the <em>muhru</em>-offering. He also received from <strong>B</strong> 6 kor (1080 l) of barley and 0;2.3 kor (90 l) of emmer for offerings each month. <strong>A</strong> gave <strong>B</strong> <em>pahīdu</em>-flour; he did not receive barley [for the regular offering (<em>sattukku</em>)], dates derived from the prebendary income, nor emmer. 6 witnesses and the scribe: Arad-Marduk/Bēl-upahhir//Bāˀiru.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-rēmanni/Mu&scaron;eb&scaron;i-Marduk//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;; <strong>B</strong> = &Scaron;umu-iddin/Nab&ucirc;-aplu-iddin//Isinnāya"
