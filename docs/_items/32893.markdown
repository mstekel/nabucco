paraphrase: "Lease of a field: <strong>C</strong> had leased part of <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s field in Bīr-ili to <strong>B,</strong> for cultivation. In this document, <strong>B</strong> gives part of this leased land to <strong>A</strong> for cultivation. He is to hoe and cultivate it in Ta&scaron;rīt. <strong>A</strong>&nbsp;is to pay the barley for seeds and the workload himself. The lessee also vouches for irrigation and guarding of the field. <strong>B</strong> is to receive half of everything grown &ndash; that is the share of the field owner &ndash; from <strong>A</strong>. 3 witnesses and the scribe: Bēl<sup>?</sup>-.../Nab&ucirc;-ittannu//broken name.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong>&nbsp;= Nab&ucirc;-zēru-ibni/Arrabi; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-rēmanni/Mu&scaron;eb&scaron;i-Marduk//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-ittannu/Ṭābia; <strong>D</strong> = L&acirc;b&acirc;&scaron;i<br /> &nbsp;"
