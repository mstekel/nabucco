paraphrase: "Promissory note for dates (damaged): <strong>B<sub>1 </sub></strong>and <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> owe <strong>A</strong> 63 kor (11340 l) of dates. They are to pay in Arahsamna (VIII), including the costs of transport to the storage house in Sippar. The purpose for which the dates were given was mentioned in a broken context, where also the name of a female slave appears. <strong>C</strong> vouches against another unknown party. Remainder of operative section missing. At least 8 witnesses and the scribe: Nidintu/Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir-nap&scaron;āti.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ikṣur/Iqī&scaron;āya//Rēˀi-sis&ecirc;; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Bazuzu/Ea-kāṣir//Babūtu; <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>&nbsp;= Erībāya/Nab&ucirc;-uballiṭ//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron; <strong>C </strong>= Bēl-rēmanni"
