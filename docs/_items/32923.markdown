paraphrase: "Lease of prebendary service: <strong>A</strong> gives to <strong>B</strong> the 23<sup>rd</sup> and 26<sup>th</sup> of &Scaron;abāṭ (XI) of his brewer&rsquo;s prebend in Ebabbar for performance. Standard clauses vouching for the continuation and punctuality of the service and the quality of the beer follow. <strong>A</strong> is to receive the prebendary income directly from the temple&rsquo;s assets. <strong>B</strong> is to pay <strong>A</strong> 1 kor of barley each year. 5 witnesses and the scribe: Bēl-ittannu/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-i&scaron;kun//Balāṭu. Addenda: <strong>A</strong> receives the barley for the 36<sup>th</sup> year. Each party has taken a copy of the document.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Ubāru/Bēl-iqī&scaron;a//Isinnāya; <strong>B</strong> = Bēl-rēmanni/Mu&scaron;eb&scaron;i-Marduk//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;"
