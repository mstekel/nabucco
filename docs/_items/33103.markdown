paraphrase: "Lease of a field:<strong> A</strong> partly subleases a field located in Bīr-ili for cultivation to <strong>B</strong>. He had also previously sublet this land, which belongs to <strong>D</strong>, from <strong>C</strong>. <strong>B</strong> is to pay the necessary materials and barley for seeds himself. They equally share the grown products. A third share remains in their communal possession. <strong>B</strong> vouches for the growth of [the date-palms] and the guarding of the field. Witnesses and scribe lost.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-rēmanni/Mu&scaron;eb&scaron;i-Marduk//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;; <strong>B </strong>= Aplāya/Kalbāya; <strong>C</strong>&nbsp;= Bēl-ittannu/Ṭābia; <strong>D </strong>= L&acirc;b&acirc;&scaron;i"
