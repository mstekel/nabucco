paraphrase: "Prebendary contract: <strong>B</strong> owes <strong>A</strong> 8 days of the brewer&rsquo;s prebend in the Ebabbar, the temple of &Scaron;ama&scaron;. <strong>C</strong> vouches for the performance. The service comprises 2 days in [month x], 2 days in Simān (III), 1 day [in month x, 1 day in month y]. 6 more days are further defined in broken context. A promissory note that might come up in <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s house is to be invalidated. For the barley of <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s performance, <strong>B</strong> is to give <strong>C</strong> the brewed beer. A clause concerning failing to perform on pain of 12 shekels of white silver against <strong>B</strong> follows. 3 witnesses and the scribe: Bēl-iddin/Aplāya//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Akkad.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = &Scaron;āpik-zēri/Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Ea; <strong>B</strong>&nbsp;= Iddin-Nab&ucirc;/Bēl-idddin; <strong>C</strong>&nbsp;= Bēl-rēmanni/Mu&scaron;eb&scaron;i-Marduk//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;<br /> &nbsp;"
