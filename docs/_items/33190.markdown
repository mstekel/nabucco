paraphrase: "Oath concerning payment of debt: <strong>A</strong> swears by Bēl, Nab&ucirc; and the king to pay <strong>B</strong> 10 kor (1800 l) of barley in D&ucirc;zu (IV) of the 11<sup>th</sup> year. This amount corresponds to part of a larger debt for 21 kor (3780 l): <strong>A</strong> undertakes to deliver the remaining 11 kor (1980 l) in Ayyār (II) of the 12<sup>th</sup> year. This deal does not include an earlier claim of <strong>B</strong>, nor the promissory note of <strong>C</strong> charged against <strong>A</strong>. 5 witnesses and the scribe: Nidintu/Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir-nap&scaron;āti//I&scaron;&scaron;akku.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-rēmanni/Mu&scaron;eb&scaron;i-Marduk//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;; <strong>B</strong>&nbsp;= Rēmūtu/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-zēru-ibni; <strong>C&nbsp;</strong>= Nab&ucirc;-iddin<br /> &nbsp;"
