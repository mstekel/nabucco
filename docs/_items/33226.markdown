paraphrase: "Field as security (damaged): Beginning of obverse lost. <strong>A</strong>&nbsp;takes <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s field as security for a debt charged against his father <strong>C</strong>. The field lies next of those of <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong>, in the vicinity of the town. <strong>A</strong> takes 1/3 of the dates harvest as part of the payment. In case <strong>B</strong> disagrees, <strong>A</strong> is to have the yield estimated for the summer. <strong>A</strong> may employ a gardener of his choice. The income for portions of meat (<em>pīru</em>) from the 7<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> day every month, in total 2 portions of meat and 2 <em>makkasu</em>-cuts, are <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s security for 1/3 mina of silver. A clause denying <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s rights on any income and <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s rights on the interests follows. Remainder lost.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong> = Bēl-rēmanni/Mu&scaron;eb&scaron;i-Marduk//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;; <strong>B</strong>&nbsp;= Nab&ucirc;-bullissu/&Scaron;ama&scaron;-iddin; <strong>C</strong>&nbsp;= &Scaron;ama&scaron;-iddin, father of <strong>B</strong>; <strong>D<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;</strong>= Bēl-upāqu/Guzānu//broken name; <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong>&nbsp;= Bazuzu/Ardia//Balāṭu<br /> &nbsp;"
