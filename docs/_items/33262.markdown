paraphrase: "Receipt for silver: <strong>A</strong> receives from <strong>B</strong> 13 shekels of stamped silver of 1/8 alloy: this is part of a larger debt (<em>u&rsquo;iltu</em>) amounting to 1 5/6 mina of silver, which <strong>B </strong>owes him. Another unspecified amount of silver must have been already delivered, as indicated by a clause which exludes an earlier receipt. Each party hast taken a copy. 2 witnesses and the scribe (= <strong>A</strong>).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>A</strong>&nbsp;= Rēmūt-Gula/&Scaron;umu-ukīn//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-parakki; <strong>B</strong>&nbsp;= Bēl-rēmanni/Mu&scaron;eb&scaron;i-Marduk//&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron;<br /> &nbsp;"
