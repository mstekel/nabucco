paraphrase: "Administrative list over the distribution of <em>han&scaron;u</em> land: Cadastral map of <em>han&scaron;u</em> plots and their associated <em>rab han&scaron;e</em>s, which were granted by the king. The plots reach from the area (<em>līmu</em>) of the temple as far as Bit-Ahhe&scaron;āya. Originating from the Bab-nār-&scaron;arri, the front of each <em>han&scaron;u</em> field measures 300 cubits (150 m). Among the <em>rab han&scaron;&ecirc;</em>&rsquo;s we find <em>inter alia</em> Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir/Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-ēre&scaron;, Mukīn-zēri/Nab&ucirc;-udammiq, &Scaron;umāya/Zabunu, Nab&ucirc;-&scaron;umu-ēre&scaron;/Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;allim and the governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>) Na&rsquo;id-Marduk."
