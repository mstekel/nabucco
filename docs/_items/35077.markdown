paraphrase: "Settlement of a dispute concerning a purse: As decided at court, <strong>A</strong> will seek the purse (<em>hindu</em>) of <strong>C</strong>, his uncle. In case <strong>A</strong> does not find the purse, <strong>B</strong> will swear an oath to <strong>A</strong> that he does not have the purse. In case <strong>A</strong> finds the purse, <strong>B</strong> is cleared. There is also a deposit involved. Witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-nebiana-ili; <strong>B</strong> = Bulluṭu; <strong>C</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-uballiṭ; Scribe = Gimillu/Ri&scaron;ua"
