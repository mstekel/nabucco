For the period between the first and the third year of Hallu&scaron;ū, the interest is already included in the loan amount (<em>hubuttūtu</em>). If <strong>B</strong> fails to pay within this period, the debt will bear a monthly interest of 1 shekel per mina (20% p.a.). The debt is secured by the pledge of a garden (<em>kir&ucirc;</em>) at the gate? (<em>&uacute;</em>-<em>bul</em>-<em>lum</em>, <em>abullu</em>) of Kanisurra. 4 witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ēṭir/Nab&ucirc;-nāṣir; <strong>B</strong> = Tabnēa/&Scaron;umu-iddin; Scribe = Ina-tē&scaron;&icirc;-ēṭir/Nab&ucirc;-nāṣir"
