The field of <strong>B</strong> borders on (the property of) <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>. The part which goes as far as the river is &ndash; according to the limiting marks (<em>ina kandur&icirc;</em>) excluded and belongs to <strong>D</strong>. In case there is a surplus of the field of <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong> will receive it for 0;0.1 square kor (450 m<sup>2</sup>).
