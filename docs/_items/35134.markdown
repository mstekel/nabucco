paraphrase: "Purchase of a built house in Uruk (written on a stone tablet):<strong> A</strong> purchases a built house (<em>bītu ep&scaron;u</em>) for 3 1/3 minas of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), together with an additional payment (<em>atru</em>) of 10 shekels of silver, from <strong>B</strong>. The sold house is located in the district of the Kanisurra Canal (<em>erṣet nār Kanisurra</em>) inside Uruk. Its upper side (in the north) borders on the house of <strong>C</strong> and its lower side (in the south) on a narrow street (<em>sūqu qatnu</em>). Its upper front (in the east) borders on the inner side of the field (<em>libbi eqli</em>) of the seller and its lower front (in the west) borders on the canal (<em>nāru</em>) extending to the seven date palms (<em>gi&scaron;immaru</em>) on the island (<em>ina uṣalli</em>). It measures 47 x 42 cubits (23.5 x 21 m). Except for the common penalty clauses, also elaborate curses are written on this stone tablet. The transaction is concluded in the presence of (<em>ina u&scaron;uzzi</em>) the governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>) of Uruk (Ahhē&scaron;āya) and the <em>&scaron;atammu</em> of Eanna (name lost). 20 witnesses and the scribe. Instead of a seal impression (<em>kunukku</em>), fingernail impression (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Aidaˀ//Sagranu; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-&scaron;ullim//Kuddiya; <strong>C</strong> = &Scaron;ākin-&scaron;umi//Nummuru; Scribe = Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;allim//Balāṭu"
