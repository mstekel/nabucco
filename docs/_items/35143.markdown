paraphrase: "Dialogue document over the redemption of debts: <strong>B </strong>approaches <strong>A</strong>, his brother, and asks him to pay off his debts of 2 &frac12; minas of silver and to give him another &frac12; mina of silver for his own maintenance (<em>akālu</em>). <strong>A </strong>grants this request and receives a sealed document (<em>kunukku</em>) concerning <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s share (<em>zittu</em>) in <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s property. The transaction is concluded in the presence of (<em>ina u&scaron;uzzi</em>) the governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>) of Ur (S&icirc;n-tabni-uṣur). 5 witnesses and the scribe. Instead of a seal impression (<em>kunukku</em>), fingernail impression (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the seller.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = S&icirc;n-ahu-iddin/&Scaron;āpiku; <strong>B</strong> = Gula-balāssu-iqbi/&Scaron;āpiku; <strong>C</strong> = Bēl-iqbi; Scribe = &Scaron;umāya//Naziya"
