paraphrase: "Partly broken legal document over the redemption of a debt of silver: <strong>B</strong> has to pay 4 minas of silver to his two brothers <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> on the 25th(?) of Ta&scaron;rīt (VII). If he manages to do so, <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> will give him the orchards. If this is not the case, the orchards will belong to<strong> A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>. In either case, <strong>B</strong> is not entitled to give the orchards to anyone else. If he gives back the money according to the tablet of Kurigalzu, <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2 </sub></strong>will purchase the orchards. Witnesses and the scribe.<br /> <br /> <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nādin/Kudurānu; <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bēl-iddin/Kudurānu; <strong>B</strong> = Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;allim/Kudurānu; Scribe = Bēl-iddin/Munnabitu"
