paraphrase: "Purchase of a date garden: <strong>A</strong> purchases 2;2.3 kor (432 l) (or 2;2.4 kor [438 l]?), cultivated date garden (<em>kir&icirc;</em> <em>gi&scaron;immari</em>) for 1/3 mina and 5 shekels of silver in pieces (<em>&scaron;ibirtu</em>), together with an additional payment (<em>atru</em>) of &frac12; shekel of silver, from <strong>B<sub>1</sub>, <sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>3</sub></strong>. The sold garden is located in the irrigation area (<em>tamirtu</em>) Hama&scaron;u of the district (<em>pihātu</em>) of the Gutean City (URU <em>qu</em>-<em>ta</em>-<em>a</em>-<em>a</em>-<em>nu</em>). Its upper side (in the north) borders on (the property of) <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and its lower side (in the south) on the garden of <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>. Its upper front (in the west) borders on the royal road (<em>harrān &scaron;arri</em>) and its lower front (in the east) on the irrigation canal (<em>harru</em>) of <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong>. Surprisingly, the payment clause only talks about 1;2.4 kor (276 l) garden. Rather than being a mistake, this circumstance seems to be connected with the subsequent clause. Though partly broken, this uncommon clause seems to determine that it is upon the buyer <strong>A</strong> to choose which part of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s land he exactly wants to take over. The following penalty clause determines that in case of any rebellion (<em>sīhu</em>) and claims (<em>pāqirānu</em>) towards <strong>A</strong>, <strong>A</strong> is entitled to take into his possessions (<em>ina libbi ṣabātu</em>) another garden of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> which is located in front of the city (<em>mihrat āli</em>) and borders on the city gate (<em>abullu</em>) and the canal (<em>nāru</em>) of a second garden (<em>kir&ucirc; &scaron;an&ucirc;</em>) as well as on the properties of <strong>C<sub>4</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>5</sub></strong>. 11 witnesses and the scribe. Instead of a seal impression (<em>kunukku</em>), fingernail impression (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the three sellers.<br /> <br /> <strong>A</strong> = Upāqu/Lā-bā&scaron;i//&Scaron;igūa; <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-erība/Ahhēa; <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> = Bunānītum, mother of B1; <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>3</sub></strong> = Eri&scaron;tu, wife of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>; <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> = &Scaron;ulāya/Nab&ucirc;-ēre&scaron;; <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> = Aliaˀu; <strong>C<sub>3</sub></strong> = Balāssu; <strong>C<sub>4</sub></strong> = Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;ēzib/Hiṭā; <strong>C<sub>5</sub></strong> = Banūnu//S&icirc;n-bēl-zēri; Scribe = Nergal-u&scaron;ēzib//Damqa"
